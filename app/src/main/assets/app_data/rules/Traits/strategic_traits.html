<h3><strong>3 - Master of Ambush</strong></h3>

<p>Your Warlord and three non-vehicle units of your choice have the Infiltrate special rule.</p>

<h3><strong>4 - Strategic Genius</strong></h3>

<p>You add +1 to any Seize the Initiative roll. In addition, whilst your Warlord is alive, you can re-roll any Reserve Rolls (failed or successful).</p>

<h3><strong>5 - Divide to Conquer</strong></h3>

<h3><strong>6 - Princeps of Deceit</strong></h3>
