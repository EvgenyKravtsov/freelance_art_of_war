<h2><strong>D6 - Result</strong></h2>

<h3><strong>1 - Tactical Genius</strong></h3>

<p>Whilst your Warlord is alive, you can discard up to 2 Active Tactical Objectives at the end of your turn instead of only 1.</p>

<h3><strong>2 - Master of Interference</strong></h3>

<p>One use only. Declare your Warlord is using this ability at the end of one of your turns. Your opponent must randomly select one of his Active Tactical Objectives and immediately discard it.</p>

<h3><strong>3 - Well Prepared</strong></h3>

<p>Generate one additional Tactical Objective on your First Turn.</p>

<h3><strong>4 - Forward Planning</strong></h3>

<p>After generating Tactical Objectives on your First Turn, you can immediately choose to use this Warlord Trait. If you do so, discard all your Active Tactical Objectives; generate a new Tactical Objective for each one that was discarded.</p>

<h3><strong>5 - Master of Fate</strong></h3>

<p>Whilst your Warlord is alive, you can re-roll the dice when determining how many Victory Points are awarded for Tactical Objectives that award a random number of Victory Points when scored.</p>

<h3><strong>6 - Lead by Example</strong></h3>

<p>Any &lsquo;Secure Objective X&rsquo; Tactical Objective, where X is a number between 1 and 6, that is scored because your Warlord or his unit controls that Objective Marker, scores 1 additional Victory Point.</p>
