<h2><strong>Twin-linked</strong></h2>

<p>Twin-linked weapons don&rsquo;t get more shots than normal ones, but they give you a better chance of hitting with them. If a shooting weapon has the twin-linked special rule, or is described in a model&rsquo;s wargear entry as twin-linked, it re-rolls all failed To Hit rolls.</p>

<p><strong>Twin-linked Blast Weapons</strong></p>

<p>If the scatter dice does not roll a hit, you can choose to re-roll the dice with a Twin-linked Blast weapon. If you choose to do so, you must re-roll both the 2D6 and the scatter dice.</p>

<p><strong>Twin-linked Template Weapons</strong></p>

<p>Twin-linked Template weapons are fired just like a single weapon, but must re-roll failed To Wound rolls and armour penetration rolls.</p>
