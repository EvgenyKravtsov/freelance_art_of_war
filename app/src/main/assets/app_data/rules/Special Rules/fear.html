<h2><strong>Fear</strong></h2>

<p>At the start of each Fight sub-phase, a unit in base contact with one or more enemy models that cause Fear must take a Leadership test (called a Fear test) before any blows are struck. If the test is passed, all is well and there is no effect. If the test is failed, the unit succumbs to fear &ndash; all models in the unit have their Weapon Skill reduced to 1 for the remainder of that Fight sub-phase. Note that a model that causes Fear is not itself immune to Fear, and will still need to take a Fear test if it is base contact with any enemy models that cause Fear.</p>
