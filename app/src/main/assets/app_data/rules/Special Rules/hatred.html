<h2><strong>Hatred</strong></h2>

<p>This rule is often presented as Hatred (X) where X identifies a specific type of foe. If the special rule does not specify a type of foe, then the unit has Hatred against everyone. This can refer to a Faction, or a specific unit. For example, Hatred (Orks) means any model with the Ork Faction, whilst Hatred (Big Meks) means only Big Meks. A model striking a hated foe in close combat re-rolls all failed To Hit rolls during the first round of each close combat.</p>
