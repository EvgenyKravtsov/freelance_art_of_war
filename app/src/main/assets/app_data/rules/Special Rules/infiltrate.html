<h2><strong>INFILTRATE</strong></h2>

<p>Units that contain at least one model with this special rule are deployed last, after all other units (friend and foe) have been deployed. If both sides have Infiltrators, the players roll-off and the winner decides who goes first, then alternate deploying these units. Infiltrators can be set up anywhere on the table that is more than 12&quot; from any enemy unit, as long as no deployed enemy unit can draw line of sight to them. This includes in a building, as long as the building is more than 12&quot; from any enemy unit. Alternatively, they can be set up anywhere on the table more than 18&quot; from any enemy unit, even in plain sight. If a unit with Infiltrate deploys inside a Dedicated Transport, they may Infiltrate along with their Transport. A unit that deploys using these rules cannot charge in their first turn. Having Infiltrate also confers the Outflank special rule to units of Infiltrators that are kept as Reserves.</p>

<p><strong>Outflank</strong></p>

<p>During deployment, players can declare that any unit that contains at least one model with this special rule is attempting to Outflank the enemy. When this unit arrives from Reserves, but not Ongoing Reserve, the controlling player rolls a D6: on a 1-2, the unit comes in from the table edge to the left of their controlling player&rsquo;s own table edge; on a 3-4, they come on from the right; on a 5-6, the player can choose left or right. Models move onto the table as described for other Reserves. If a unit with Infiltrate deploys inside a Dedicated Transport, they may Outflank along with their Transport.</p>

<p><strong>Infiltrate and Scout</strong></p>

<p>If a unit has both the Infiltrate and Scout special rule, that unit can deploy as per the Infiltrate special rule and then redeploy as per the Scout special rule.</p>
