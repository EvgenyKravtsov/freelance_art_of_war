<h2><strong>Psychic Pilot</strong></h2>

<p>A vehicle with this special rule is a Psyker. This rule is typically presented with a Mastery Level, shown in brackets &ndash; if no Mastery Level is shown then that vehicle has a Mastery Level of 1. Rules for generating and manifesting psychic powers can be found in the Psychic phase section. The unit follows all the normal rules for generating and manifesting psychic powers, with the following clarification: the vehicle is considered to have a Leadership characteristic of 10, should this be needed in order to resolve any psychic power or Perils of the Warp.</p>
