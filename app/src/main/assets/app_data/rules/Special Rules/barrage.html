<h1><strong>BARRAGE</strong></h1>

<p>All Barrage weapons use blast markers and consequently use the rules for Blast weapons, as indicated by their profile, with the following exceptions:</p>

<p>&bull; Barrage weapons can fire indirectly. This means they can fire at a target that they do not have line of sight to, as long as the target is beyond their minimum range (if applicable). When firing indirectly, the Ballistic Skill of the firer is not subtracted from the scatter distance; unless a Hit! is rolled on the scatter dice, the blast marker always scatters a full 2D6&quot;. If a Barrage weapon has line of sight to its target it can fire directly, even if the target is within its minimum range.</p>

<p>&bull; To determine whether a unit wounded by a Barrage weapon is allowed a cover save, and when determining Wound allocation, always assume the shot is coming from the centre of the blast marker, instead of from the firing model. Hits against vehicles are always resolved against their side armour.</p>

<p><strong>Multiple Barrages</strong></p>

<p>If a unit fires more than one shot with the Barrage special rule, they fire together, as follows:</p>

<p>&bull; The Barrage weapon closest to the target unit fires first. Place the blast marker over the target, then roll for scatter as described earlier.</p>

<p>&bull; Once the first marker is placed, roll a scatter dice for each other Barrage weapon shot fired by the unit. If an arrow is rolled, place the marker in the direction indicated so that it is next to and touching the edge of the first marker placed (see diagram below).</p>

<p>touches any part of any marker in the group that has already been placed. Note that it is perfectly fine if some markers are placed overlapping one another (including being directly over the top of a previous marker).</p>

<p>&bull; Once all of the markers are in place, add up the number of hits and roll To Wound for these hits. To determine Wound allocation and cover saves, always assume the shot is coming from the centre of the first blast marker that was placed in the Multiple Barrage.</p>

<p><strong>Apocalyptic Barrage</strong></p>

<p>An Apocalyptic Barrage follows all of the rules for a Barrage weapon, but uses the clovershaped apocalyptic barrage marker. Before the marker is placed, the attacker is allowed to rotate the marker about its centre to maximise the number of models that could potentially be hit. Place the marker and roll for scatter in the same way you would for a Blast. If the marker scatters, be careful to maintain the same orientation as you move it. Once the final position of the marker has been determined, roll a number of dice equal to the number of attacks on the weapon&rsquo;s profile. So, for example, with a weapon with the type &lsquo;Heavy 4, Apocalyptic Barrage&rsquo;, you would roll four dice. Each dice roll corresponds to a &lsquo;strike&rsquo; on one of the circles on the apocalyptic barrage marker. For example, each roll of a 2 indicates a strike on circle number 2. Resolve the strikes as for a Multiple Barrage, as if each were a Barrage attack that had landed on that circle and hit all the models underneath it. To determine Wound allocation and cover saves, always assume the shot is coming from the centre of the entire apocalyptic barrage marker.</p>
