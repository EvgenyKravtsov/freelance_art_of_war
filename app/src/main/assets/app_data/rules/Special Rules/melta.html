<h2><strong>Melta</strong></h2>

<p>Ranged weapons with this special rule roll an additional D6 when rolling to penetrate a vehicle&rsquo;s armour at half range or less. If the weapon is more than half its maximum range away, it rolls to penetrate as normal. If a weapon has both the Melta and Blast special rules, measure the distance to the centre of the blast marker after it has scattered. If this is half the weapon&rsquo;s range or less, all hits caused by the blast marker roll an addition D6 when rolling to penetrate a vehicle&rsquo;s armour. If the centre of the blast marker is more than half the weapon&rsquo;s maximum range away after scatter, roll to penetrate as normal. See the Vehicles rules for more details on armour penetration.</p>
