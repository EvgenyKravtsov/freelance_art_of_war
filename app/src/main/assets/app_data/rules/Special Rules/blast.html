<h2><strong>Blast</strong></h2>

<p>When firing a Blast weapon, models do not roll To Hit. Instead, just pick one enemy model visible to the firer and place the 3&quot; blast marker with its hole entirely over the base of the target model (see diagram), or its hull if the target is a vehicle. The hole at the centre of the marker must be within the weapon&rsquo;s maximum range. You cannot place the blast marker so that the base or hull of any friendly model is even partially under it. The large area affected by the blast means it&rsquo;s going to be very hard to miss completely. Nonetheless, the shot might not land exactly where intended. Roll for the blast marker to scatter and subtract the firer&rsquo;s Ballistic Skill from the distance (if any) that it scatters, to a minimum of 0&quot;. Note that it is possible, and absolutely fine, for a shot to scatter beyond the weapon&rsquo;s maximum or minimum range and line of sight. This represents the chance of ricochets, the missile blasting through cover and other random events. In these cases, hits are worked out as normal and can hit and wound units out of range and line of sight (or even your own units, or models locked in combat). If the shot scatters so that the hole in the centre of the marker is beyond the table&rsquo;s edge, the shot is a complete miss and is discarded. Once the final position of the blast marker has been determined, take a good look at it from above &ndash; each unit suffers one hit for each of their models which is fully or partially beneath the blast marker, even if those models are not within the firer&rsquo;s line of sight. Once the number of hits inflicted on the unit has been worked out, roll To Wound and save as normal. Remember that any Wounds inflicted by weapons with the Blast special rule must be allocated to the closest model in the target unit even if it is out of sight of any models from the attacking unit.</p>

<p><strong>Multiple Blasts</strong></p>

<p>If a unit is firing more than one shot with the Blast special rule, scatter each shot, one at a time, as described above and determine how many hits are scored with each individual blast marker. After the last shot, add up the total number of hits scored and roll all of the To Wound rolls as normal.</p>

<p><strong>Blast Weapons and Re-rolls</strong></p>

<p>If a model has the ability to re-roll its rolls To Hit and chooses to do so after firing a Blast weapon, the player must re-roll both the scatter dice and the 2D6.</p>

<p><strong>Blast Weapons and Snap Shots</strong></p>

<p>Blast weapons cannot be fired as Snap Shots.</p>

<p><strong>Large Blast</strong></p>

<p>Large Blast weapons use the 5&quot; blast marker, but otherwise obey all the rules for Blast weapons.</p>

<p><strong>Massive Blast</strong></p>

<p>Massive Blast weapons use the 7&quot; blast marker, but otherwise obey all the rules for Blast weapons.</p>

<p><strong>Apocalyptic Blast</strong></p>

<p>Apocalyptic Blast weapons use the 10&quot; blast marker, but otherwise obey all the rules for Blast weapons.</p>

<p><strong>Apocalyptic Mega-blast (5&quot;/7&quot;/10&quot;)</strong></p>

<p>Apocalyptic Mega-blast weapons use the apocalyptic blast marker. They obey the rules for Blast weapons, with the following exceptions:</p>

<p>&bull; Apocalyptic Mega-blast weapons have three Strength values and three AP values. Correspondingly, the apocalyptic blast marker is divided into three zones, as shown in the diagram to the far right, one for each Strength and AP value.</p>

<p>&bull; The Strength and AP of any hits depends on the zone where the target model is located. The first Strength and AP value are used for the inner zone, the second Strength and AP value are used for the middle zone, and the third Strength and AP value are used for the outer zone. Always use the best Strength and AP if a model straddles two or more zones. If a unit has models in several zones, work out the hits inflicted for each zone separately. Note that there will be a different Wound pool for each zone.</p>

<p>For example, an Aquila macro-cannon firing a quake shell has the Apocalyptic Mega-blast special rule, a Strength of 10/7/5 and an AP value of 1/4/6. The Strength and AP values for the three zones are therefore:</p>

<p><strong>Zone - S - AP</strong></p>

<p>Inner - 10 - 1</p>

<p>Middle - 7 - 4</p>

<p>Outer - 5 - 6</p>

<p>A unit with 3 models in the inner zone and 5 models in the middle zone would suffer 3 Strength 10 AP1 hits, and 5 Strength 7 AP4 hits.</p>

<p>&bull; To determine whether a unit wounded by an Apocalyptic Mega-blast weapon is allowed a cover save, and when determining Wound allocation, always assume the shot is coming from the centre of the apocalyptic blast marker, instead of from the firing model.</p>

<p>&bull; Hits from Apocalyptic Mega-blast weapons made against vehicles are always resolved against their side armour.</p>
