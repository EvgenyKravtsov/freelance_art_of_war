<h2><strong>Soul Blaze</strong></h2>

<p>If a unit suffers one or more unsaved Wounds from an attack with this special rule, it is set ablaze and continues to burn &ndash; mark it with a coin or counter as a reminder. At the end of each turn, roll a D6 for each unit with a Soul Blaze counter on it. On a 3 or less, the flames die out and the unit is no longer ablaze &ndash; remove your reminder counter. On a 4+, the unit takes D3 Strength 4 AP5 hits with the Ignores Cover special rule. These Wounds are Randomly Allocated. A unit cannot have more than one Soul Blaze counter on it at a time.</p>
