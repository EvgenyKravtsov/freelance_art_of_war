<h2><strong>Arriving by Deep Strike</strong></h2>

<p>Roll for the arrival of all Deep Striking units as specified in the rules for Reserves and then deploy them as follows:</p>

<p>&bull; First, place one model from the unit anywhere on the table, in the position where you would like it to arrive, and roll for scatter to determine the model&rsquo;s final position. If a vehicle scatters when arriving via Deep Strike, do not change its facing &ndash; it must continue to face the same direction as it did before you rolled for scatter.</p>

<p>&bull; Next, the unit&rsquo;s remaining models are arranged around the first one. Models must be placed in base contact with the first model and begin to form a circle around it. When the first circle is complete, a further concentric circle must be placed with each model touching the circle inside it. Each circle must include as many models as will fit.</p>

<p>&bull; Models deploying via Deep Strike treat all difficult terrain as dangerous terrain. In the Movement phase during which they arrive, Deep Striking units may not move any further, other than to disembark from a Deep Striking Transport vehicle if they are in one. Units Deep Striking into ruins are placed on the ground floor. Deep Striking units count non-ruined buildings (except for their battlements) as impassable terrain. In that turn&rsquo;s Shooting phase, these units can fire (or Run, Turbo-boost or move Flat Out) as normal, and count as having moved in the previous Movement phase. Vehicles, except for Walkers, count as having moved at Combat Speed (even Immobilised vehicles). This can affect the number of weapons they can fire with their full Ballistic Skill. In that turn&rsquo;s Assault phase, however, these units cannot charge. This also applies to units that have disembarked from Transports that arrived by Deep Strike that turn.</p>

<p><strong>Deep Strike and Transports</strong></p>

<p>Units do not confer the Deep Strike special rule onto a Transport vehicle they are embarked inside. A Transport vehicle with Deep Strike may Deep Strike regardless of whether its passengers have Deep Strike or not.</p>

<p><strong>Deep Strike Mishaps</strong></p>

<p>Deep Striking onto a crowded battlefield can be dangerous, as one may miss the intended objective or even materialise inside solid rock! If any of the models in a Deep Striking unit cannot be deployed, because at least one model would land partially or fully off the table, in impassable terrain, on top of a friendly model, or on top of or within 1&quot; of an enemy model, something has gone wrong. The controlling player must roll on the Deep Strike Mishap table and apply the results. If the unfortunate unit is also a Transport, the Deep Strike Mishap result applies to both the unit and anything embarked within it.</p>
