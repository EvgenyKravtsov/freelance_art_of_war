<h2><strong>Vortex</strong></h2>

<p>A weapon with this special rule is a Destroyer weapon and uses a blast marker of some type (e.g. blast, large blast, massive blast, etc). Place the appropriate marker, roll for scatter and apply damage. For determining Wound allocation, always assume the shot is coming from the centre of the marker, in the same manner as a Barrage weapon. The marker for a Vortex weapon is not removed from play after damage has been resolved. Leave it in play on the tabletop. The marker is impassable terrain as long as it remains in play. At the beginning of every subsequent player turn, the marker scatters 2D6&quot; (use the little arrow if you roll a Hit!). If a double is rolled, the marker is removed from play instead. Any unit under the marker&rsquo;s new location is hit. Apply damage as described above.</p>
