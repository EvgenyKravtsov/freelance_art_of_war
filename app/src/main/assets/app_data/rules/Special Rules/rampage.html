<h2><strong>Rampage</strong></h2>

<p>At the start of any Fight sub-phase, models with the Rampage special rule gain +D3 attacks if the combat they are in contains more enemy models than friendly models &ndash; count all models locked in the combat, not just those models that are engaged. Roll once to determine the number of bonus Attacks all Rampaging models involved in that combat receive that phase. A model that has made a disordered charge that turn receives no benefit from Rampage.</p>
