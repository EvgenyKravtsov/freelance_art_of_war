<h2><strong>Feel No Pain</strong></h2>

<p>When a model with this special rule suffers an unsaved Wound, it can make a special Feel No Pain roll to avoid being wounded (this is not a saving throw and so can be used against attacks that state that &lsquo;no saves of any kind are allowed&rsquo;, for example those inflicted by Perils of the Warp). Feel No Pain saves may not be taken against Destroyer attacks or against unsaved Wounds that have the Instant Death special rule. Roll a D6 each time an unsaved Wound is suffered. On a 4 or less, you must take the Wound as normal. On a 5+, the unsaved Wound is discounted &ndash; treat it as having been saved. If a unit has the Feel No Pain special rule with a number in brackets afterwards &ndash; Feel No Pain (6+), for example &ndash; then the number in brackets is the D6 result needed to discount the Wound.</p>
