<h2><strong>Pinning</strong></h2>

<p>If a non-vehicle unit suffers one or more unsaved Wounds from a weapon with the Pinning special rule, it must take a Leadership test once the firing unit has finished its shooting attacks for that phase. This is called a Pinning test. If the unit fails the test, it is Pinned and must immediately Go to Ground. As the unit has already taken its saves, Going to Ground does not protect it against the fire of the Pinning weapon that caused the test &ndash; it&rsquo;s too late! As long as the test is passed, a unit can be called upon to take multiple Pinning tests in a single turn, but only once for each unit shooting at them. If a unit has already Gone to Ground, no further Pinning tests are taken. If the special rules of a unit specify that the unit can never be Pinned, the unit automatically passes Pinning tests. Such units can still Go to Ground voluntarily if they wish.</p>
