<h2><strong>Zealot</strong></h2>

<p>A unit containing one or more models with the Zealot special rule automatically passes Pinning, Fear and Regroup tests and Morale checks, but cannot Go to Ground and cannot choose to fail a Morale check due to the Our Weapons Are Useless rule. If a unit gains the Zealot special rule when it has Gone to Ground, all the effects of Go to Ground are immediately cancelled. In addition, units containing one or more models with the Zealot special rule re-roll all failed To Hit rolls during the first round of each close combat &ndash; they do not get to re-roll failed To Hit rolls in subsequent rounds.</p>
