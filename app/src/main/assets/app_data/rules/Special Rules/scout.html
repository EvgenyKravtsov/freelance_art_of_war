<h2><strong>Scout</strong></h2>

<p>After both sides have deployed (including Infiltrators), but before the first player begins his first turn, a unit containing at least one model with this special rule can choose to redeploy. If the unit is Infantry, Artillery, a Walker or a Monstrous Creature, each model can redeploy anywhere entirely within 6&quot; of its current position. If it is any other unit type, each model can instead redeploy anywhere entirely within 12&quot; of its current position. During this redeployment, Scouts can move outside the owning player&rsquo;s deployment zone, but must remain more than 12&quot; away from any enemy unit. A unit that makes a Scout redeployment cannot charge in the first game turn. A unit cannot embark or disembark as part of a Scout redeployment. If both sides have Scouts, roll-off; the winner decides who redeploys first. Then alternate redeploying Scout units. If a unit with this special rule is deployed inside a Dedicated Transport, it confers the Scout special rule to the Transport (though a disembarkation cannot be performed as part of the redeployment). Note that a Transport with this special rule does not lose it if a unit without this special rule is embarked upon it. Having Scout also confers the Outflank special rule to units of Scouts that are kept as Reserves.</p>

<p><strong>Outflank</strong></p>

<p>During deployment, players can declare that any unit that contains at least one model with this special rule is attempting to Outflank the enemy. When this unit arrives from Reserves, but not Ongoing Reserve, the controlling player rolls a D6: on a 1-2, the unit comes in from the table edge to the left of their controlling player&rsquo;s own table edge; on a 3-4, they come on from the right; on a 5-6, the player can choose left or right. Models move onto the table as described for other Reserves. If a unit with Scouts is deployed inside a Dedicated Transport, they may Outflank along with their Transport.</p>

<p><strong>Iinfiltrate and Scout</strong></p>

<p>If a unit has both the Infiltrate and Scout special rule, that unit can deploy as per the Infiltrate special rule and then redeploy as per the Scout special rule.</p>
