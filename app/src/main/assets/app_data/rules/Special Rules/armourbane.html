<h3><strong>Armourbane</strong></h3>

<p>If a model has this special rule, or is attacking with a Melee weapon that has this special rule, it rolls an additional D6 for armour penetration in close combat. If a model makes a shooting attack with a weapon that has this special rule, it rolls an additional D6 for armour penetration. In either case, this special rule has no effect against non-vehicle models.</p>
