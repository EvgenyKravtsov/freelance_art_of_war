<h1><strong>Shrouded</strong></h1>

<p>A unit that contains at least one model with this special rule counts its cover save as being 2 points better than normal. Note that this means a model with the Shrouded special rule always has a cover save of at least 5+, even if it&rsquo;s in the open. Cover save bonuses from the Shrouded and Stealth special rules are cumulative (to a maximum of a 2+ cover save).</p>
