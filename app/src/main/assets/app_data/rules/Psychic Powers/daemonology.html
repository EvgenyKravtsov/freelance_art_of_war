<h1><strong>Primaris Power</strong></h1>

<h2>BANISHMENT - Warp Charge…………1</h2>

<p>Banishment is a malediction that targets a single unit with the Daemon special rule
within 24". Whilst this power is in effect, all models in the target unit suffer a -1 penalty
to their invulnerable save (normally reducing it to 6+). This is cumulative with any other
modifiers to a Daemon’s invulnerable save, but cannot make it worse than 6+.
</p>


<h2>1 - GATE OF INFINITY - Warp Charge……………1</h2>

<p>Gate of Infinity is a blessing that targets the Psyker. Unless the target is Zooming or
Swooping, remove the target and his unit from the board. It then immediately arrives
anywhere on the board using the rules for Deep Strike.
</p>

<h2>2 - HAMMERHAND - Warp Charge…………… 1</h2>

<p>Hammerhand is a blessing that targets the Psyker. Whilst the power is in effect, the
Psyker and his unit have +2 Strength.</p>

<h2>3 - SANCTUARY - Warp Charge…………1</h2>

<p>Sanctuary is a blessing that targets the Psyker. Whilst the power is in effect the Psyker
and all models in his unit receive a +1 bonus to their invulnerable save (models that do
not have an invulnerable save gain a 6+ invulnerable save whilst this power is in effect
instead). In addition, all units with the Daemon special rule (friend or foe) treat all
terrain, including open ground, within 12" of the Psyker as dangerous terrain.
</p>



<h2>4 - PURGE SOUL - Warp Charge……………1</h2>

<p>Purge Soul is a focussed witchfire power with a range of 24". Both the Psyker and the
target model roll a D6 and add their respective Leadership values. If the target’s total is
greater than the Psyker’s total, nothing happens. If the Psyker’s total is greater than or
equal to the target’s total, the target model suffers an automatic Wound with no armour or cover saves allowed. Purge Soul has no effect on vehicles.</p>

<h2>5 - CLEANSING FLAME - Warp Charge…………2</h2>

<h2>6 - VORTEX OF DOOM - Warp Charge…………3</h2>

the Psyker fails his Psychic test, he automatically suffers Perils of the Warp.</p>
