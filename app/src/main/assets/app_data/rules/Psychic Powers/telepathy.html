<h1><strong>Primaris Power</strong></h1>

<h2>PSYCHIC SHRIEK - Warp Charge 1</h2>

<p>Psychic Shriek is a witchfire power with a range of 18". Roll 3D6 and subtract the
target’s Leadership – the target unit suffers a number of Wounds equal to the result.
Armour and cover saves cannot be taken against Wounds caused by Psychic Shriek.
</p>



<h2>1 - DOMINATE - Warp Charge 1</h2>

<p>Dominate is a malediction that targets a single enemy unit within 24". Whilst the power
is in effect, the target unit must pass a Leadership test each time it attempts to move,
manifest a psychic power, shoot, Run or declare a charge – if the test is failed, the action
is forfeit and the unit can do nothing else that phase. A unit that fails this test when
attempting to fire Overwatch does not fire any shots, but acts normally in the ensuing
Fight sub-phase.
</p>

<h2>2 - MENTAL FORTITUDE - Warp Charge 1</h2>

<p>Mental Fortitude is a blessing that targets a single friendly unit within 24". If the target
is falling back, it immediately Regroups. In addition, whilst the power is in effect, the
target gains the Fearless special rule.
</p>

<h2>3 - TERRIFY - Warp Charge 1</h2>

<p>Terrify is a malediction that targets a single enemy unit within 24". Whilst the power is
in effect, the target has a -1 penalty to their Leadership and treats all enemy units as
having the Fear special rule. Furthermore, the target must take a Morale check at the end
of the Psychic phase.
</p>



<h2>4 - SHROUDING - Warp Charge 1</h2>

<p>Shrouding is a blessing that targets the Psyker. Whilst this power is in effect, the Psyker,
and all friendly models within 6" of the Psyker, have the Shrouded special rule.
</p>

<h2>5 - INVISIBILITY - Warp Charge 2</h2>

<p>Invisibility is a blessing that targets a single friendly unit within 24". Whilst the power is
in effect, enemy units can only fire Snap Shots at the target unit and in close combat will
only hit models in it on To Hit rolls of a 6.
</p>

<h2>6 - HALLUCINATION - Warp Charge 2</h2>

<p>Hallucination is a malediction that targets a single enemy unit within 24". Roll once
this power has been successfully manifested to determine the manner of hallucinations
the target is suffering from (roll once for the whole unit).
</p>

<h2>D6 - Result</h2>
<h3>1-2 - Bugs! I Hate Bugs! </h3>
<p>The unit must take a Pinning test.</p>

<h3>3-4 - It’s So Beautiful!</h3>
<p>Whilst the power is in effect, all models in the unit suffer a -1 penalty to their
Weapon Skill, Ballistic Skill, Initiative and Attacks (to a minimum of 1).
</p>

<h3>5-6 - You! You’re a Traitor! </h3>
<p>Randomly select one character in the target unit. That model suffers a single Strenght 3 hit for every other model in the target unit. Cover saves cannot be taken against these hits, and they can never be allocated to another model. If there are no character models apart from the character model, treat this result as It's So Beautiful! instead.</p>
