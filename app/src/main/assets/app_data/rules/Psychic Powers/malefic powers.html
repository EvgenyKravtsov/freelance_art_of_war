<h2>SUMMONING - Warp Charge…………3</h2>

<p>Summoning is a conjuration with a range of 12" that creates one of the following units
(your choice): 10 Bloodletters of Khorne, 10 Pink Horrors of Tzeentch, 10 Plaguebearers
of Nurgle, 10 Daemonettes of Slaanesh, 5 Flesh Hounds of Khorne, 3 Flamers of
Tzeentch, 3 Nurgling swarms or 5 Seekers of Slaanesh. Rules for these units can be found

<h2>1 - CURSED EARTH - Warp Charge…………1</h2>

<p>Cursed Earth is a blessing that targets the Psyker. Whilst the power is in effect, all
models with the Daemon special rule (friend or foe) within 12" of the Psyker have a +1
bonus to their invulnerable save (normally increasing it to 4+). This is cumulative with
any other modifiers to a Daemon’s invulnerable save. In addition, whilst the power is in
effect, friendly units with the Daemon special rule will not scatter when arriving from
Deep Strike Reserve so long as the first model is placed within 12" of the Psyker.

<h2>5 - INCURSION - Warp Charge…………3</h2>

entire unit as casualties). If, when using this power, the Psyker fails his Psychic test, he
automatically suffers Perils of the Warp.
