<h1><strong>D6 - Result</strong></h1>

<h3><strong>1 - Sabotaged!</strong></h3>
<p>At the end of the turn in which the objective was identified,
and at the end of every turn thereafter, roll a D6. On a roll of 1 all units within
3" of the Objective Marker suffer D6 Strength 4 AP- hits.</p>



<h3><strong>2 - Nothing of Note. </strong></h3>
<p>This has no additional affect.</p>


<h3><strong>3 - Skyfire Nexus. </strong></h3>
<p>A unit that controls this objective can choose whether or
not all of the models in it have the Skyfire special rule each time they shoot.
</p>



<h3><strong>4 - Targeting Relay. </strong></h3>
<p>A unit controlling this objective re-rolls failed To Hit
rolls of 1 when shooting.
</p>



<h3><strong>5 - Scatterfield. </strong></h3>
<p>A unit that controls this objective counts its cover saves as
being 1 point better than normal (so a unit in the open would have a 6+ cover
save). This bonus is cumulative with the Stealth and Shrouded special rules.
</p>



<h3><strong>6 - Grav Wave Generator. </strong></h3>
<p>Any unit attempting to charge a unit in control of
this objective subtracts 2 from its charge range (to a minimum of 0). This is
cumulative with the penalty for charging through Difficult Terrain, if
applicable.
