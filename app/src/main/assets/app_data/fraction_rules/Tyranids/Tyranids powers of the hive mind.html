<h1><strong>POWERS OF THE HIVE MIND</strong></h1>

<h3><strong>Many Tyranids are also Psykers. They do not draw power from the Warp in any fathomable way, but rather they harness a fraction of the Hive Mind&rsquo;s gestalt will. This makes no difference for game purposes and these models follow all the normal rules for Psykers &ndash; a Perils of the Warp attack they suffer instead represents massive cerebral trauma or synaptic feedback. Tyranid Psykers use the Powers of the Hive Mind, which is treated as a psychic discipline for all rules purposes.</strong></h3>

<h1><strong>Primaris Power</strong></h1>

<h2><strong>Dominion - Warp Charge 1</strong></h2>

<p>Dominion is a <strong>blessing</strong> that targets the Psyker. Whilst this power is in effect the Psyker adds 6&quot; to its synapse range.</p>

<h2><strong>1. Catalyst - Warp Charge 1</strong></h2>

<p>Catalyst is a <strong>blessing</strong> that targets the Psyker&rsquo;s unit and up to one other friendly unit from Codex: Tyranids that is within 12&quot;. Whilst this power is in effect, the targets gain the Feel No Pain special rule.</p>

<h2><strong>2. The Horror - Warp Charge 1</strong></h2>

<p>The Horror is a <strong>malediction</strong> that targets a single enemy unit within 24&rdquo;. The target must immediately take a Pinning test (as described for the Pinning special rule in the Warhammer 40,000 rulebook) with a -2 modifier to their Leadership.</p>

<h2><strong>3. Onslaught - Warp Charge 1</strong></h2>

<p>Onslaught is a <strong>blessing</strong> that targets a single friendly unit within 24&quot;. Whilst this power is in effect, the target unit can both Run and then shoot in its Shooting phase.</p>

<h2><strong>4. Paroxysm - Warp Charge 1</strong></h2>

<p>Paroxysm is a <strong>malediction</strong> that targets a single enemy unit within 24&quot;. Whilst this power is in effect, the target unit&rsquo;s Weapon Skill and Ballistic Skill are both reduced by D3 (roll once and apply the result to both characteristics).</p>

<h2><strong>5. Psychic Scream - Warp Charge 1</strong></h2>

<p>Psychic Scream is a <strong>nova</strong> power with a range of 6&quot;. For each target unit, roll 2D6+2 and subtract their Leadership. That unit suffers a number of Wounds equal to the result. Armour and cover saves cannot be taken against Wounds caused by Psychic Scream.</p>

<h2><strong>6. Warp Blast - Warp Charge 2</strong></h2>
