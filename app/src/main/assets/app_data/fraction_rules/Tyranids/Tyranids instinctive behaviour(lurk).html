<h1><strong>D6 - Lurk Result</strong></h1>

<h2><strong>1-3 - Survive: </strong></h2>

<p>The unit is treated as having failed a Morale test and must immediately Fall Back.</p>

<h2><strong>4-5 - Seek Cover: </strong></h2>

<p>In the Movement phase, the unit is not slowed by difficult terrain, though its models must take Dangerous Terrain tests as normal. In the Shooting phase, the unit can Run, but it can only shoot if it is in a building or area terrain (if the unit is partially within area terrain, only those models within area terrain are allowed to shoot). The unit cannot charge in the Assault phase.</p>

<h2><strong>6 - Stalk: </strong></h2>

<p>This follows all the rules for Seek Cover (above). In addition, the unit gains the Stealth special rule.</p>
