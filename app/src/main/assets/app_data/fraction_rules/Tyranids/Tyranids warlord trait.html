<h3><strong>1 - Nature&rsquo;s Bane: </strong></h3>

<p>At the beginning each of your Movement phases, you may select one forest, jungle or wood terrain piece within 12&quot; of your Warlord. That terrain piece becomes a Carnivorous Jungle (see the Mysterious Forest table in the Warhammer 40,000 rulebook) and remains so for the remainder of the game, even if it was previously a different type of forest.</p>

<h3><strong>2 - Heightened Senses: </strong></h3>

<p>The Warlord, and all friendly models from Codex: Tyranids within 12&quot; of it, have the Night Vision special rule.</p>

<h3><strong>3 - Synaptic Lynchpin: </strong></h3>

<p>The Warlord&rsquo;s synapse range is 18&quot;.</p>

<h3><strong>4 - Mind Eater:</strong></h3>

<p>Your army gains 2 Victory Points for each enemy model with the Independent Character special rule slain by your Warlord in a challenge. Killing an Independent Character as the result of a sweeping advance does not award these Victory Points.</p>

<h3><strong>5 - Digestive Denial: </strong></h3>

<p>After deployment, but before Scout redeployments and Infiltrate deployments, nominate one piece of terrain in the enemy deployment zone (this may not be one your opponent has purchased as part of their army). The terrain piece&rsquo;s cover save is reduced by one for the duration of the game (to a minimum of 6+). Note that a piece of terrain can only be affected by this ability once.</p>

<h3><strong>6 - Adaptive Biology: </strong></h3>

<p>If the Warlord suffers one or more unsaved Wounds, it gains the Feel No Pain (5+) special rule at the beginning of its next Movement phase and keeps it for the remainder of the game.</p>
