<h1><strong>D6 - Feed Result</strong></h1>

<h2><strong>1-3 - Cannibalistic Hunger: </strong></h2>

<p>The unit immediately suffers a number of hits equal to the number of models in that unit. These hits are resolved using the unit&rsquo;s majority Strength (if drawn, use the highest) and AP-. Wounds are allocated by the owning player and armour saves (but not cover saves) may be taken. After resolving casualties (if any) the unit can do nothing else until the end of its turn. Units consisting of only a single model treat this result as Devour (below), instead.</p>

<h2><strong>4-5 - Devour: </strong></h2>

<p>In the Shooting phase, the unit cannot shoot or Run. In the Assault phase, if the unit is able to declare a charge, it must do so against the closest viable enemy unit. If the unit cannot declare a charge, it does nothing in the Assault phase.</p>

<h2><strong>6 - Kill: </strong></h2>

<p>This follows all the rules for Devour (above). In addition, the unit gains the Rage special rule.</p>
