<h2>SPECIAL ISSUE WARGEAR</h2>

<h3>BLASTING CHARGES</h3>

<p>Created from scavenged detonators and low-end demolition gear, the short-fused blasting charges used by Genestealer Cultists can be hurled into the enemy ranks to sow death and disruption ahead of a concerted assault. Blasting charges follow the rules for assault grenades, as described in Warhammer 40,000: The Rules.</p>

<h3>CULT ICON</h3>

<p>The power of the cult’s icon is not to be underestimated. Symbolising the faith of the cultists that bear that same symbol upon their flesh, its presence focusses the aggression of the devoted to a razor edge. All models in a unit with the cult icon have +1 Weapon Skill whilst the bearer is alive.</p>

<h3>GENESTEALER FAMILIAR</h3>

<p>Though small, the hissing familiars attracted to the side of the Patriarch and the Magus are swift, vicious, and eerily strong. In close combat, a model with a Genestealer familiar makes two additional Strength 4 AP- attacks with the Rending special rule. A Genestealer familiar is represented by a separate miniature that always remains as close as possible to its master. The model itself is purely decorative, and is ignored for game purposes – just move it to one side if it gets in the way. Remove the familiar once its master has been slain.</p>

<h3>SACRED CULT BANNER</h3>

<p>The sight of a cult’s banner flying in the hot breeze of war stirs the soul of the Patriarch’s chosen. Such rapture can send the devoted throng into a frenzy of contempt for the unblessed adversary. Friendly units that have the Genestealer Cult Faction and are within 12" of a model equipped with a sacred cult banner have the Furious Charge special rule.</p>

<h3>TOXIN INJECTOR</h3>

<p>The tubes of a toxin injector coat a Primus’ claws in deadly poisons – a mere scratch from such a talon can quickly prove fatal. If a model with a toxin injector fights using his rending claws, those attacks have the Poisoned special rule</p>
