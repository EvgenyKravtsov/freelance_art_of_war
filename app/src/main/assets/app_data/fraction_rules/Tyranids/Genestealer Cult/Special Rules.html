<h3>CULT AMBUSH</h3>

<p>Units with this special rule that Infiltrate, or that arrive from Reserve or Ongoing Reserve, can choose to roll on the Cult Ambush table, opposite, instead of deploying or arriving from Reserves normally. Unless otherwise specified, ambushing units move onto the table as described for other Reserves and cannot move any further during the Movement phase of the turn they deploy or arrive on the battlefield. Units cannot use the Cult Ambush special rule whilst they are embarked inside a vehicle.</p>

<h3>RETURN TO THE SHADOWS</h3>

<p>Instead of moving in your Movement phase, any unit with this special rule that is not within 6" of any enemy models, can be removed from the battlefield and placed into Ongoing Reserve. A unit cannot Return to the Shadows in the same turn it arrives from Reserves or Ongoing Reserves, and cannot do so whilst embarked in a vehicle.</p>

<h3>UNQUESTIONING LOYALTY</h3>

<p>A model with this special rule automatically passes Look Out, Sir attempts, and can even make Look Out, Sir attempts when fighting in a challenge.</p>
