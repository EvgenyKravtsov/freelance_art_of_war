<h2>SACRED RELICS OF THE CULT</h2>

<h3>ICON OF THE CULT ASCENDANT</h3>

<p>Friendly units that have the Genestealer Cult Faction and are within 12" of a model equipped with the Icon of the Cult Ascendant have the Furious Charge special rule and can re-roll failed Morale, Pinning and Fear tests. In addition, models in the same unit as the Icon of the Cult Ascendant have +1 Attack whilst the bearer is alive.</p>

<h3>DAGGER OF SWIFT SACRIFICE</h3>

<p>When it makes its close combat attacks, a model with the Dagger of Swift Sacrifice can instead make a single attack, rolling To Hit as normal, using the following profile:</p>

<table border="1" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="1" style="width:500px;">
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td style="text-align: center;"><strong>Range</strong></td>
			<td style="text-align: center;"><strong>S</strong></td>
			<td style="text-align: center;"><strong>AP</strong></td>
			<td style="text-align: center;"><strong>Type</strong></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td style="text-align: center;">-</td>
			<td style="text-align: center;">User</td>
			<td style="text-align: center;">-</td>
			<td style="text-align: center;">Melee, Instant Death, Poisoned (2+)</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

<h3>SCOURGE OF DISTANT STARS</h3>

<p>If the bearer is involved in a challenge, their opponent must pass a Toughness test before any attacks are made. If the test is failed, that model immediately suffers a Wound with no saves of any kind allowed, and a -1 penalty to both their Initiative and Attacks (to a minimum of 1) until the end of the phase. The Scourge of Distant Stars has no effect on vehicles.</p>

<h3>STAFF OF THE SUBTERRAN MASTER</h3>

<p>Instead of shooting normally, the bearer can use the Staff of the Subterran Master to make a shooting attack with the following profile:</p>

<table border="1" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="1" style="width:500px;">
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td style="text-align: center;"><strong>Range</strong></td>
			<td style="text-align: center;"><strong>S</strong></td>
			<td style="text-align: center;"><strong>AP</strong></td>
			<td style="text-align: center;"><strong>Type</strong></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td style="text-align: center;">18"</td>
			<td style="text-align: center;">2</td>
			<td style="text-align: center;">-</td>
			<td style="text-align: center;">Assault 10, Ignores Cover, Rending</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

<h3>SWORD OF THE VOID’S EYE</h3>

<table border="1" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="1" style="width:500px;">
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td style="text-align: center;"><strong>Range</strong></td>
			<td style="text-align: center;"><strong>S</strong></td>
			<td style="text-align: center;"><strong>AP</strong></td>
			<td style="text-align: center;"><strong>Type</strong></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td style="text-align: center;">-</td>
			<td style="text-align: center;">+1</td>
			<td style="text-align: center;">3</td>
			<td style="text-align: center;">Melee, Bio-sentience, Life Drain</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

<p><strong>Bio-sentience:</strong> The bearer can re-roll all To Hit and To Wound rolls of 1 when attacking with this weapon.<br>
<strong>Life Drain:</strong> Any To Wound roll of 6 made with this weapon has the Instant Death special rule.</p>

<h3>THE CROUCHLING</h3>

<p>In close combat, a model accompanied by the Crouchling makes two additional Strength 4 AP- attacks with the Rending special rule. In addition, the bearer can generate one additional psychic power at the start of the game.</p>

<p>The Crouchling is represented by a separate miniature that always remains as close as possible to its master. The model itself is purely decorative, and is ignored for game purposes – just move it to one side if it gets in the way. Remove the Crouchling once its master has been slain.</p>
