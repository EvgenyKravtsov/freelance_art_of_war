<h2>CULT VEHICLE EQUIPMENT</h2>

<p>Rules for the following can be found in Warhammer 40,000: The Rules: Dozer blade, heavy stubber, hunter-killer missile, searchlight, smoke launchers, storm bolter.</p>

<h3>CACHE OF DEMOLITION CHARGES</h3>

<p>In the Shooting phase, one model embarked upon a vehicle equipped with demolition charges can choose to throw one instead of firing its normal weapon, using the profile shown below:</p>

<table border="1" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="1" style="width:500px;">
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td style="text-align: center;"><strong>Range</strong></td>
			<td style="text-align: center;"><strong>S</strong></td>
			<td style="text-align: center;"><strong>AP</strong></td>
			<td style="text-align: center;"><strong>Type</strong></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td style="text-align: center;">6"</td>
			<td style="text-align: center;">8</td>
			<td style="text-align: center;">2</td>
			<td style="text-align: center;">Assault 1, Large Blast</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

<p>However, each time a vehicle equipped with demolition charges suffers a penetrating hit, roll a dice. On the roll of a 1, the vehicle suffers a further Strength 8 AP2 hit after any initial damage has been resolved.</p>

<h3>DRILLDOZER BLADE</h3>

<p>A vehicle with a drilldozer blade automatically passes Dangerous Terrain tests.</p>

<p>When a vehicle with a drilldozer blade Rams an enemy vehicle, add an extra D6 to the Strength of the hit. If the Ram causes a penetrating hit, add 1 to the result on the vehicle damage table.</p>

<p>When a vehicle with a drilldozer blade performs a Tank Shock, each enemy unit that the vehicle reaches must take an Initiative test before taking a Morale check. If the Initiative test is passed the unit avoids the whirring cutters, but if it is failed the unit immediately suffers D3 Strength 10 AP2 hits. If an enemy unit makes a Death or Glory attack on a vehicle with a drilldozer and fails to stop the vehicle, the unit suffers an additional D3 Strength 10 AP2 hits in addition to the damage they normally suffer for the failed attack. Hits from a drilldozer blade are Randomly Allocated.</p>
