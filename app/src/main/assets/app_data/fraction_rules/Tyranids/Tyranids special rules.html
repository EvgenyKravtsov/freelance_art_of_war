<h2><strong>INSTINCTIVE BEHAVIOUR</strong></h2>

<p>This special rule is always followed, in brackets, by a type: either Lurk, Hunt or Feed, which corresponds to a table opposite. At the beginning of each of your turns, all Codex: Tyranids units with this special rule that are outside of the synapse range of any friendly Synapse Creatures (see below) must take a Leadership test unless they are: engaged in combat, falling back, have gone to ground or arrived from reserve this turn. If the test is passed, the unit acts normally during this turn. If the test is failed, the unit must roll a D6 on the appropriate Instinctive Behaviour table. The effects of the result rolled last until the beginning of your next turn, unless specified otherwise.</p>

<h2><strong>SHADOW IN THE WARP</strong></h2>

<p>All enemy units and models with the Psyker, Psychic Pilot or Brotherhood of Psykers special rules suffer a -3 penalty to their Leadership whilst they are within 12&rdquo; of one or more models with the Shadow in the Warp special rule.</p>

<h2><strong>SYNAPSE CREATURE</strong></h2>

<p>Models with the Synapse Creature special rule have a synapse range of 12&quot;. Friendly Codex: Tyranids models within this synapse range, including the Synapse Creatures themselves, have the Fearless special rule. If a unit from Codex: Tyranids is falling back and at least one of the unit&rsquo;s models is within a friendly Synapse Creature&rsquo;s synapse range before the unit moves, the unit automatically Regroups.</p>
