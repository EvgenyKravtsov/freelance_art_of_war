If a unit contains two or more loci, only the strongest takes effect &ndash; the rules for the others are ignored whilst there is a stronger loci in the unit. If the model with the strongest locus is slain, the next strongest loci in the unit immediately comes into effect. If there are two loci of the same tier, you choose which applies.</p>
