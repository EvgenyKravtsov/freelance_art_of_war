<h3><strong>DAEMONIC ALIGNMENT</strong></h3>

<p>Daemons can only join units that are composed entirely of Daemons of the same alignment as themselves (i.e. a Herald of Slaanesh may not join a unit of Plaguebearers).</p>

<h3><strong>DAEMON OF KHORNE</strong></h3>

<p>Daemons of Khorne have the Daemon, Furious Charge and Hatred (Daemons of Slaanesh) special rules. Chariots with this rule resolve their Hammer of Wrath hits at Strength 7.</p>

<h3><strong>DAEMON OF TZEENICH</strong></h3>

<p>Daemons of Tzeentch have the Daemon and Hatred (Daemons of Nurgle) special rules. When manifesting psychic powers, Daemons of Tzeentch have a +3 modifier to their Leadership. In addition, Daemons of Tzeentch re-roll all saving throw results of 1.</p>

<h3><strong>DAEMON OF NURGLE</strong></h3>

<p>Daemons of Nurgle have the Daemon, Hatred (Daemons of Tzeentch), Shrouded and Slow and Purposeful special rules. In addition, units that are composed entirely of Daemons of Nurgle are treated as having defensive grenades.</p>

<h3><strong>DAEMON OF SLAANESH</strong></h3>

<p>Daemons of Slaanesh have the Daemon, Fleet, Hatred (Daemons of Khome) and Rending special rules. In addition, units composed entirely of Daemons of Slaanesh Run an additional 3&quot; (this will normally be 06+3&quot;). Units that are entirely composed of Cavalry models instead Run an additional 6&quot;. Vehicles that are not Walkers move an extra 3&quot; whenever they move Flat Out instead.</p>

<h3><strong>DAEMONIC INSTABILITY</strong></h3>

<p>A unit with this special rule cannot be joined by a model without this special rule. Units with this special rule automatically pass Fear, Pinning and Morale tests (and cannot choose to fail any of these tests). When a unit with the Daemonic Instability special rule loses an assault, it must take a Daemonic Instability test at the Check Morale step of the Fight sub-phase. This uses the Concaving procedure:</p>

<p>1) The unit takes a Leadership test. If the dice roll is a double 1 or double 6. the Daemons&#39; presence fluctuates:</p>

<p><strong>Double I - Reality Blinks: </strong> All Wounds suffered by the unit during this phase are restored. Any models from this unit that were removed as casualties during this phase immediately return to play in coherency with a model in their unit that has not itself returned to play through Reality Blinks this phase. Models returning to play in this fashion must be placed at least 1&quot; away from enemy models, unless those models are from units locked in close combat with the returning model&#39;s unit. If the returning model&#39;s unit is locked in close combat, the returning model immediately makes a Pile In move. Models that cannot be placed in this way do not return.</p>

<p><strong>Double 6 - Banished!: </strong> Remove the entire unit from play as casualties. Enemy units that were locked in combat with only the banished unit immediately consolidate.</p>

<p>2) Now, assuming that the unit has not rolled a Reality Blinks or a Banished! result, compare the dice roll to the Daemons&#39; Leadership value, taking into account modifiers, including any from the combat result. For each point the unit fails its Daemonic Instability test by, it suffers one additional Wound, allocated by the unit&#39;s owning player, and with no saves of any kind allowed. Note that a failed Daemonic Instability test does not cause a Daemon unit to fall back - once any casualties have been removed, the unit remains locked in combat.</p>
