<h1><strong>D6 DAEMONIC REWARD</strong></h1>

<p><strong>0 Hellforged Artefact: </strong> The Daemon has a Hellforged Artefact of your choice. Each can be chosen only once per army. If your army already includes all the Hellforged Artefacts, you cannot swap any further Exalted Rewards for this result.</p>

<p><strong>1 Doubly Blessed: </strong> Roll again on this table, re-rolling further results of 1, and roll once on the Lesser Rewards table. The Daemon has both these rewards at no additional cost.</p>

<p><strong>2 Riftbringer: </strong> At the end of any Assault phase in which this Daemon causes one or more unsaved Wounds, roll 2D6, adding I to the total for every full 3 unsaved Wounds the Daemon caused this phase. If the total is less than 9, nothing happens. If the total is 9 or greater, a new unit of Daemons is created as described for a Summoned from the Warp result.</p>

<p><strong>3 Souleater: </strong> At the end of any Assault phase in which the Daemon caused one or more unsaved Wounds, roll a D6. On a 2+ it gains a single Wound (to a maximum of 10). Note that this may take the Daemon above its starting number of Wounds.</p>

<p><strong>4 Unholy Frenzy: </strong> The Daemon has the Rage and Rampage special rules</p>

<p><strong>5 Warp Tether: </strong> The first time the Daemon is slain it is not removed from play as a casualty, but instead is removed from the battlefield. Any enemy unit locked in combat solely with this model immediately consolidates. The Daemon is then placed in ongoing reserve with a single Wound remaining. If the model with Warp Tether is riding a Chariot, the first time it is slain the entire model is removed and placed in ongoing reserve &mdash; the Chariot&#39;s remaining Hull Points, damage results, etc, are unaffected.</p>

<p><strong>6 Wind of Chaos: </strong> Wind of Chaos is a weapon with the following profile:</p>

<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<th>
			<p align="center"><strong>Range</strong></p>
			</th>
			<th>
			<p align="center"><strong>S</strong></p>
			</th>
			<th>
			<p align="center"><strong>AP</strong></p>
			</th>
			<th>
			<p align="center"><strong>Type</strong></p>
			</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p align="center">24&rdquo;</p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p align="center">2D6</p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p align="center">4</p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p align="center">Assault 1, Blast, Flux</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

<p><strong>Flux: </strong> Roll to determine the Strength immediately after the target has been nominated. If an 11 or 12 is rolled, Wind of Chaos is resolved at Strength 10 and has the large Blast special rule instead of Blast.</p>
