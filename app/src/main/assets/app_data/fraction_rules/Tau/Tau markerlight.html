<h3><strong>Target Acquired: </strong></h3>

<p>Markerlights cannot directly cause damage or Wounds. Instead, each time a unit suffers a hit with this special rule, place a markerlight counter next to it (no saves can be taken against these hits). Markerlight counters remain next to their unit until the end of the current phase or until they are used (whichever comes first).</p>

<p>Immediately before a unit from Codex: Tau Empire shoots at a target that has one or more markerlight counters, it can declare it is using one or more of the markerlight abilities listed below. Each ability costs a number of markerlight counters - remove this number of markerlight counters from the target immediately when the ability is declared. A unit can combine any number of markerlight abilities providing that there are enough counters.</p>

<p>Note that as markerlight counters are removed from the target before the shooting attack is made, it is impossible for a unit to benefit from its own markerlights.</p>

<p><strong>&bull; Pinpoint - </strong>Markerlight cost: 1 +</p>

<p>All models firing at the target as part of this shooting attack gain a bonus to their Ballistic Skill for the duration of the shooting attack. The size of this bonus is equal to the number of markerlight counters expended on this ability. Pinpoint can increase the Ballistic Skill of Snap Shots and Overwatch.</p>

<p><strong>&bull; Scour - </strong>Markerlight cost: 2</p>

<p>All weapons fired at the target as part of this Shooting attack gain the Ignores Cover special rule.</p>

<p><strong>&bull; Seeker - </strong>Markerlight cost: 1 +</p>

<p>For each markerlight counter expended on this ability, the unit immediately fires a single seeker missile (if it has one) in addition to any other weapons it is permitted to fire. A seeker missile fired in this way:</p>

<p>- Does not need line of sight.</p>

<p>- Must be fired at the same target as the vehicle&#39;s other weapons.</p>

<p>- Is resolved at Ballistic Skill 5.</p>

<p>- Has the Ignores Cover special rule.</p>

<p>- Does not reduce the number of weapons a vehicle can fire at its full Ballistic Skill.</p>

<p>- Does count towards the limit of 2 missiles that a flyer can fire each turn.</p>
