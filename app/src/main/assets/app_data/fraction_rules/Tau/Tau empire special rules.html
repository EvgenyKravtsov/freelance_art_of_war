<h1><strong>BONDING KNIFE RITUAL</strong></h1>

<p>A unit consisting entirely of models with this special rule (not counting drones) benefits from Heroic Morale, even if they are not accompanied by an Independent Character.</p>

<h1><strong>SUPPORTING FIRE</strong></h1>

<p>When an enemy unit declares a charge, all friendly models with this special rule in units within 6&quot; of the charging unit&#39; target can choose to fire Overwatch as if they were also targets of the charge. Remember that a unit can still only fire Overwatch once each phase.</p>

<h1><strong>DRONES</strong></h1>

<p>A unit comprised entirely of drones is a non-scoring, non-denial unit. Drones do not have the Bulky special rule.</p>

<h1><strong>UNIT UPGRADE DRONES</strong></h1>

<p>Drones taken as upgrades for a unit act as additional squad members in all regards. They are unable to leave their unit and must maintain unit coherency with their unit at all times. Drones taken as upgrades cannot purchase options, however, and so do not pay for them if their unit does so.</p>

<p><em>For example: If a unit of six Fire Warriors takes two Gun Drones and purchases EMP grenades, they only pay 12 points for the EMP grenades (2 points for each Fire Warrior in the squad).</em></p>

<h1><strong>INDEPENDENT CHARACTERS AND DRONES</strong></h1>

<p>Independent Characters who have taken drones as upgrades are still permitted to join units, in which case both the character and his drones join the unit. If the Independent Character then leaves the unit, all his surviving drones also leave the unit, forming a separate unit with him.</p>

<p>If the Independent Character is killed whilst part of a unit, his surviving drones are thereafter part of that unit and cannot leave it; the Independent Character&#39;s unit has, for the purposes of Victory Points, been destroyed.</p>

<p>If the Independent Character is killed while he is not joined to another unit, do not remove any surviving drones - the unit is not destroyed until all the drones have been destroyed as well. These drones cannot join other units. Another Independent Character can j oin the surviving drones, but as they are not his upgrades, he cannot take them with him if he then joins another unit.</p>

<h1><strong>VEHICLE DRONES</strong></h1>

<p>Some vehicles include two drones - these start the game attached to the vehicle.</p>

<h1><strong>ATTACHED DRONES</strong></h1>

<p>Whilst attached to the vehicle, drones are treated as embarked passengers (although they don&#39;t count against a vehicle&#39;s Transport Capacity and they can even be attached to a vehicle that doesn&#39;t have a Transport Capacity). This means that while they are attached, they can make shooting attacks as if they were passengers shooting from Fire Points, using their location on the vehicle to determine line of sight, range etc. Unlike other models shooting from Fire Points, attached drones must shoot at the same target as the vehicle they are attached to. Target Acquired abilities used by a Tau vehicle, or vehicle squadron, also apply to any attached drones in the unit.</p>

<p>If a vehicle is destroyed before it has detached its drones, the drones are automatically destroyed along with it.</p>

<h1><strong>DETACHING DRONES</strong></h1>

<p>During any friendly Movement phase, drones may detach from their vehicle in the same way as Infantry disembarking from an Open-topped Transport. All drones from a vehicle or vehicle squadron must detach at the same time - they then form a single new unit.</p>

<p>After detaching, drones cannot re-attach to any vehicle, but they can embark on Transport vehicles in the same manner as other drones.</p>

<p>Drones that started the game attached to a vehicle do not award Victory Points when destroyed. In addition, your opponent only needs to destroy the vehicle, and not that vehicle&#39;s detached drones as well, to be awarded any Victory Points it is worth.</p>

<p><strong>Afterburners: </strong>Can Turbo-boost like Jetbikes.</p>

<p><strong>Blademaster: </strong>When in a challenge, Aun&#39;Shi must choose a fighting stance - Patient Blade or Killing Blade - each turn, before any rolls.</p>

<p>&bull; Patient Blade: re-roll all failed saving throws that phase.</p>

<p>&bull; Killing Blade: Rending for that phase.</p>

<p><strong>Defender of the Greater Good: </strong>Stealth Shas&#39;ui and Shas&#39;vre models in Shadowsun&#39;s unit have Sworn Protector.</p>

<p>Failure is Not An Option: All friendly Tau Empire models within 12&quot; use the Ethereal&#39;s Ld for Fear, Morale, Pinning and Regroup tests. A slain Ethereal is worth an extra Victory Point.</p>

<p><strong>Fight on Foot: </strong>Can only join Fire Warriors or Pathfinders.</p>

<p><strong>Fighting Retreat: </strong>Darkstrider and unit Consolidate after firing Overwatch.</p>

<p><strong>Great Invocation: </strong>Aun&#39;Va invokes two elemental powers per turn.</p>

<p><strong>Hammerhead Ace: </strong>Longstrike&#39;s Hammerhead is BS 5. Longstrike also dies if his Hammerhead is destroyed, but provides no additional Victory Points.</p>

<p><strong>High Velocity Deployment: </strong>Can disembark during its move even if Zooming. A Sun Shark Bomber that moves before its drones disembark can continue its move immediately after they disembark.</p>

<p><strong>Invocation of the Elements: </strong>At the start of each Movement phase, choose one of the four elemental powers. The Ethereal, and all friendly non-vehicle Tau Empire models within 12&quot; benefit from the power until the start of the Ethereal&#39;s next Movement phase. If the Ethereal is slain, the power ends.</p>

<p>&bull; Calm of Tides: Stubborn.</p>

<p>&bull; Storm of Fire: Fire an extra shot with pulse weapons when target is within half range. This affects Kroot pulse rounds but not pulse bombs.</p>

<p>&bull; Sense of Stone: Feel No Pain (6+).</p>

<p>&bull; Zephyr&#39;s Grace: Fire Snap Shots after running.</p>

<p><strong>Nova Reactor: </strong>Declare an attempt to use the reactor at the start of each of its Movement phases. If using the reactor, roll a D6. On a 1-2, the Riptide fails and suffers a Wound (no saves allowed). On 3+, you can choose an ability listed below to have (until the start of your next Movement phase).</p>

<p>Nova Shield - 3+ invulnerable save.</p>

<p>Boost Rolls - 4D6 for Thrust Moves.</p>

<p>Ripple Fire - Fire twin-linked fusion blaster, twin-linked plasma rifle, or twin-linked SMS twice.</p>

<p>Nova-charge - Can use Nova-charge profile on weapons.</p>

<p><strong>Supreme Loyalty: </strong>While Aun&#39;Va is alive, Tau Empire models re-roll failed Fear, Morale, Pinning and Regroup tests.</p>

<p><strong>Sworn Protector: </strong>An Independent Character in a unit with a model with this special rule automatically passes Look Out, Sir attempts.</p>

<p><strong>Target Acquired: </strong>Markerlights cannot cause Wounds and saves cannot be taken against them; for each hit, place a counter next to the target. Before a unit shoots, if their target has any markerlight counters next to it, the unit can choose to use a markerlight ability (either Pinpoint, Scour or Seeker) by removing the appropriate number of counters. Units cannot use counters from their own markerlights.</p>

<p>&bull; Pinpoint (Markerlight cost = 1+): +1 BS per counter used.</p>

<p>&bull; Scour (Markerlight cost = 2): Ignores Cover.</p>

<p>&bull; Seeker (Markerlight cost = 1+): Fire 1 seeker missile per counter used.</p>

<p><strong>Turret Mounting: </strong>Recon Drones embark on Devilfish exactly like an embarked passenger, but do not count towards Transport Capacity. When so embarked, the Devilfish has a homing beacon and positional relay.</p>

<p><strong>Volley Fire: </strong>If this model, and his unit, do not move in the Movement phase, their pulse rifles and carbines fire an additional shot in the Shooting phase.</p>
