<p>When generating Warlord Traits, a Commander or Ethereal may either roll on one of the Warlord Traits tables in the Warhammer 40,000 rule book, or roll on the table presented on the right.</p>

<h2><srong>1 Precision of the Skilled Hunter. </srong></h2>

<p>Enemy models cannot take Look Out, Sir rolls against your Warlord&#39;s shooting attacks. If your Warlord has no ranged weapons, re-roll this result.</p>

<h2><srong>2 Through Unity, Devastation. </srong></h2>

<p>One use only. Declare your Warlord is using this ability at the start of one of your Shooting phases. For the duration of the phase, all friendly units from this codex within 12&quot; of the Warlord re-roll To Hit rolls of 1.</p>

<h2><srong>3 A Ghost Who Walks Amongst Us. </srong></h2>

<p>The Warlord, and his unit, move 3D6&quot; when making jet Pack thrust moves. If your Warlord is not jet Pack Infantry, re-roll this result.</p>

<h2><srong>4 Exemplar of the Selfless Cause. </srong></h2>

<p>One use only. Declare your Warlord is using this ability at the start of one of your Movement phases. All friendly units from this codex on the battlefield that have gone to ground are no longer considered gone to ground and can move, shoot and charge normally this turn.</p>

<h2><srong>5 Predator of the Skies. </srong></h2>

<p>One use only. Declare your Warlord is using this ability at the start of one of your Shooting phases. For that phase, the Warlord, and his unit, have the Skyfire special rule.</p>

<h2><srong>6 Through Boldness, Victory. </srong></h2>

<p>Your Warlord, and any unit he joins, does not scatter when arriving by Deep Strike. If your Warlord cannot Deep Strike, re-roll this result.</p>
