<p><strong>If your Warlord has the Dark Eldar Faction, these Tactical Objectives replace the Capture & Control Tactical Objectives (numbers 11-16) described in Warhammer 40,000: The Rules.</strong></p>

<p><strong>If a Warhammer 40,000 mission has the Tactical Objectives special rule, players use the normal rules for using Tactical Objectives (see Warhammer 40,000: The Rules) with the following exception: when a Dark Eldar player generates a Capture & Control objective (numbers 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 or 16), generate the corresponding Dark Eldar Tactical Objective instead, as shown in the table below. </strong></p>

<p><strong>Other Tactical Objectives (numbers 21-66) are generated normally, as described in Warhammer 40,000: The Rules.</strong></p>

<h1><strong>11 TAKE THEM ALIVE!</strong></h1>


<p>Score 1 Victory Point at the end of your turn if at least one non-vehicle enemy unit was completely destroyed during your Assault phase. If an enemy with the Independent Character special rule was removed as a casualty during your Assault phase, score D3 Victory Points instead.</p>

<h1><strong>12 FEAR AND TERROR</strong></h1>


<p>Score 1 Victory Point at the end of your turn if at least one enemy unit failed a single Morale, Pinning or Fear test during your turn.</p>

<h1><strong>13 DEATH BY A THOUSAND CUTS</strong></h1>


<p>Score 1 Victory Point at the end of your turn if at least one model was removed as a casualty from at least 3 different enemy units during your turn. If at least one model was removed as a casualty from 6 or more different enemy units during your turn, score D3 Victory Points instead.</p>

<h1><strong>14 NO ESCAPE</strong></h1>



<p>Score 1 Victory Point at the end of your turn if at least one enemy unit that was falling back, or one enemy unit with either the Stealth or Shrouded special rule, was completely destroyed during your turn.</p>

<h1><strong>15 PAIN, IN ALL ITS FORMS</strong></h1>



<p>Score 1 Victory Point at the end of your turn if at least one enemy unit was completely destroyed during either your Shooting phase or your Assault phase. If at least one enemy unit was completely destroyed during both your Shooting phase and your Assault phase, score D3 Victory Points instead. If at least 3 enemy units were completely destroyed in both your Shooting phase and your Assault phase, score D3+3 Victory Points instead.</p>

<h1><strong>16 TROPHY HUNTER</strong></h1>


<p>When this objective is generated, your opponent must nominate one Objective Marker and one of his characters. Score 1 Victory Point at the end of your turn if you control the nominated Objective Marker or the nominated enemy character has been removed as a casualty. If you control the nominated Objective Marker at the end of your turn and the enemy character was removed as a casualty during the same turn, score 2 Victory Points instead.</p>
