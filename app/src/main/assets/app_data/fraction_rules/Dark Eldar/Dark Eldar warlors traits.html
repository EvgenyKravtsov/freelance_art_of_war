<p>When generating their Warlord Traits, a Dark Eldar Warlord may either roll on one of the Warlord Traits tables in Warhammer 40,000: The Rules, or roll on the table below.</p>

<h1><strong>D6 Warlord Trait</strong></h1>

<p><strong>1. Ancient Evil. </strong>The Warlord, and all friendly units with the Dark Eldar Faction within
12" of the Warlord, have the Fear special rule.

<p><strong>4. Hatred Eternal. </strong>The Warlord has the Hatred special rule.</p>

<p><strong>5. Blood Dancer. </strong>The Warlord receives +1 to the Weapon Skill characteristic on his profile.</p>
