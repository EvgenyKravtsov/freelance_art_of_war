<p>If your Warlord has the Necrons Faction, these Tactical Objectives replace the Capture &amp; Control Tactical Objectives (numbers 11-16) described in Warhammer 40,000: The Rules.</p>

<p>If a Warhammer 40,000 mission has the Tactical Objectives special rule, players use the normal rules for using Tactical Objectives with the following exception: when a Necron player generates a Capture &amp; Control objective (numbers 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 or 16), generate the corresponding Necrons Tactical Objective instead, as shown in the table opposite. Other Tactical Objectives (numbers 21-66) are generated normally.</p>

<h2><strong>11 Thrall of the Silent King </strong></h2>

<p>When this Tactical Objective is generated, immediately generate a bonus Tactical Objective &ndash; this does not count towards the number of Active Tactical Objectives you currently have in play. If your Warlord or his unit achieves the bonus Tactical Objective, you score both the number of Victory Points stated on the bonus Tactical Objective and an additional D3 Victory Points. If this Tactical Objective is discarded, so too is the bonus Tactical Objective (and vice versa).</p>

<h2><strong>12 Dust and Ashes </strong></h2>

<p>When this Tactical Objective is generated, nominate one of your characters with the Necrons Faction. Score 1 Victory Point at the end of the game if this character is still alive. Characters that are not on the table or are Falling Back at the end of the game count as destroyed for purposes of this Tactical Objective.</p>

<h2><strong>13 Reclaim and Recapture </strong></h2>

<p>Roll a D6 when this Tactical Objective is generated. If the result is an odd number, score D3 Victory points at the end of your turn if you control all 3 odd-numbered Objective Markers. If the result is an even number, score D3 Victory points at the end of your turn if you control all 3 even-numbered Objective Markers.</p>

<h2><strong>14 Age of the Machine </strong></h2>

<p>Score 1 Victory Point at the end of your turn if at least one gun emplacement, enemy vehicle or enemy building was destroyed during your turn. If at least 3 gun emplacements, enemy vehicles or enemy buildings were destroyed during your turn, score D3 Victory Points instead. If any of the destroyed vehicles was a Super-heavy vehicle, or if any of the destroyed buildings had the Mighty Bulwark special rule, score an additional 3 Victory Points.</p>

<h2><strong>15 Slaughter the Living </strong></h2>

<p>Score 1 Victory Point at the end of your turn if at least one enemy unit was completely destroyed during your turn.</p>

<h2><strong>16 Code of Combat </strong></h2>

<p>Score 1 Victory Point at the end of your turn if you issued at least one challenge during your turn.</p>
