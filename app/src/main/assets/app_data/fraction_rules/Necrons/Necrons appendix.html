<h1><strong>NECRONS SPECIAL RULES</strong></h1>

<p>A Necron army uses a number of special rules that are common to several of its units, which are collected here for your convenience. Special rules that are unique to particular units are presented in the relevant unit entry instead. Other, more common rules are simply listed by name &ndash; these are all described in full in the Special Rules section of Warhammer 40,000: The Rules.</p>

<h1><strong>REANIMATION PROTOCOLS</strong></h1>

<p>When a model with this special rule suffers an unsaved Wound, it can make a special Reanimation Protocols roll to avoid being wounded. This is not a saving throw and so can be used against attacks that state &lsquo;no saves of any kind are allowed&rsquo;. Reanimation Protocols rolls may even be taken against hits with the Instant Death special rule, but cannot be used against hits from Destroyer weapons or any special rule or attack that states that the model is &lsquo;removed from play&rsquo;.</p>

<p>Roll a D6 each time the model suffers an unsaved Wound, subtracting 1 from the result if the hit that inflicted the Wound had the Instant Death special rule. On a 5+, discount the unsaved Wound &ndash; treat it as having been saved. Certain special rules and wargear items can provide modifiers to this dice roll; these are cumulative, but the required dice roll can never be improved to be better than 4+.</p>

<p>If a unit has both the Reanimation Protocols and Feel No Pain special rules, you can choose to use one special rule or the other to attempt to avoid the Wound, but not both. Choose which of the two special rules you will use each time a model suffers an unsaved Wound.</p>

<h1><strong>LIVING METAL</strong></h1>

<p>A model with this special rule ignores the effects of Crew Shaken (but still loses a Hull Point). At the end of each of your turns, roll a D6 for each of your Heavy or Super-heavy vehicles with this special rule that has less than its starting number of Hull Points, but has not been destroyed. On a roll of a 6, that model regains a Hull Point lost earlier in the game.</p>
