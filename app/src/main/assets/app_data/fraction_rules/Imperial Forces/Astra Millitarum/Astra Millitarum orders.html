<h2><strong>&lsquo;First Rank, Fire! Second Rank, Fire!&rsquo;</strong></h2>

<h2><strong>&lsquo;Forwards, for the Emperor!&rsquo;</strong></h2>

<p>The ordered unit must make a shooting attack. Once this shooting attack has been resolved, the ordered unit must Run, even though a unit cannot normally Shoot and Run in the same phase.</p>

<h2><strong>&lsquo;Move! Move! Move!&rsquo;</strong></h2>

<p>The ordered unit must Run. When determining how far the unit Runs, roll three dice and use the highest result.</p>

<h2><strong>&lsquo;Suppressive Fire!&rsquo;</strong></h2>

<h2><strong>&lsquo;Bring it Down!&rsquo;</strong></h2>

<p>&lsquo;Bring it Down!&rsquo; can only be issued by a model with the Senior Officer special rule. The ordered unit must make a shooting attack. When resolving this shooting attack, all models in the ordered unit have the Tank Hunters and Monster Hunter special rules.</p>

<h2><strong>&lsquo;Fire on my Target!&rsquo;</strong></h2>

<p>&lsquo;Fire on my Target!&rsquo; can only be issued by a model with the Senior Officer special rule. The ordered unit must make a shooting attack. When resolving this shooting attack, all weapons in the ordered unit have the Ignores Cover special rule.</p>

<h2><strong>&lsquo;Get Back in the Fight!&rsquo;</strong></h2>

Unlike other orders, &lsquo;Get Back in the Fight!&rsquo; can only be issued to a unit that is falling back or that has gone to ground. The ordered unit immediately regroups if falling back, but it does not make a 3&quot; move. If the unit has gone to ground, the effects of going to ground are immediately cancelled instead. In either case, the ordered unit can act (shoot, run, charge etc.) normally for the remainder of the turn.</p>

<h1><strong>TANK ORDERS</strong></h1>

<p><strong>Tank Orders: </strong> A Tank Commander can roll 2D6 at the beginning of the Shooting phase. If the total result is 9 or less, choose one of the following Tank Orders to immediately take effect.</p>

The Tank Commander must resolve his shooting attack first. Once this shooting attack has been resolved, resolve the shooting attacks made by the rest of the unit. These must be at a different target, which cannot be a unit forced to disembark as a result of the Tank Commander&rsquo;s initial shooting attack.</p>

<h2><strong>&lsquo;Strike and Shroud!&rsquo;</strong></h2>
