<p>When generating his Warlord Traits, an Astra Militarum Warlord may either roll on one of the Warlord Traits tables in the Warhammer 40,000 rulebook, or instead roll on the table below. Note that if your Warlord is a Tank Commander, he must roll a D3 on the table below instead of a D6 &ndash; he can never roll on any other Warlord Traits table.</p>

<h1><strong>Warlord Traits Table</strong></h1>

<h2><strong>D6 WARLORD TRAIT</strong></h2>

<h3><strong>1 Grand Strategist: </strong></h3>

<p>Nominate D3 units in your primary detachment. These units gain the Outflank special rule.</p>

<h3><strong>2 Old Grudges: </strong></h3>

<p>During Deployment, before deploying Infiltrators and before Scouts redeploy, choose one Warhammer 40,000 codex. The Warlord and his unit have the Preferred Enemy special rule against all enemy units chosen from that codex.</p>

<h3><strong>3 Draconian Disciplinarian: </strong></h3>

<p>Friendly units from Codex: Astra Militarum within 12&quot; of the Warlord do not take Morale tests for suffering 25% or more casualties.</p>

<h3><strong>4 Implacable Determination: </strong></h3>

<p>The Warlord and his unit have the Relentless special rule.</p>

<h3><strong>5 Bellowing Voice: </strong></h3>

<p>Your Warlord has the Voice of Command special rule. If your Warlord already has the Voice of Command special rule, he can issue orders to friendly units from Codex: Astra Militarum that are within 18&quot; of him.</p>

<h3><strong>6 Master of Command: </strong></h3>

<p>Your Warlord has the Voice of Command special rule. If your Warlord already has the Voice of Command special rule, he can issue one additional order each turn.</p>
