<h1><strong>SPECIAL RULES</strong></h1>

<h2><strong>VOICE OF COMMAND</strong></h2>

<p>A model with this special rule is known as an officer. An officer can issue one order each turn. Orders are issued and their effects resolved at the start of your Shooting phase. If you have more than one officer, or if you have an officer that has a special rule allowing it to issue more than one order a turn, issue and resolve each order one at a time. An officer can attempt to issue an order provided he is not locked in combat, embarked in a vehicle or building, falling back, or has gone to ground. Issuing an order does not prevent the officer&#39;s unit from acting (shooting, Running etc.) later in that phase.</p>

<h2><strong>Issuing an Order</strong></h2>

<p>To issue an order, declare the order your officer is attempting to issue and select a single friendly non-vehicle unit from Codex: Militarum Tempestus that is within 12&quot; of the officer &mdash; this can be the officer&#39;s own unit if you wish. We call this unit the &#39;ordered unit&#39;. The ordered unit must then take a Leadership test to see if the order has been understood and acted upon. If the test is passed, the order takes effect as specified in its description. If the test is failed, the order does not take effect.</p>

<p>Unless an order causes the ordered unit to make a shooting attack or Run, receiving it does not prevent the ordered unit from acting later in that phase, whether the order was successful or not.</p>

<p>Orders cannot be issued to embarked units or units that previously received an order that phase (whether or not that order was successful). Unless otherwise stated, orders cannot be issued to units that are locked in combat, are falling back, or have gone to ground.</p>

<h2><strong>Inspired Tactics</strong></h2>

<p>If a double 1 is rolled for the ordered unit&#39;s Leadership test, once the order has been resolved all further orders issued, by any officer, are automatically successful for the remainder of this turn.</p>

<h2><strong>Incompetent Command</strong></h2>

<p>If a double 6 is rolled for the ordered unit&#39;s Leadership test, the order does not take effect, and no further orders can be issued, by any officer, for the remainder of this turn.</p>
