<h3><strong>Hammerhand - Warp Charge 1</strong></h3>

<p>Hammerhand is a <strong>blessing</strong> that is used at the start of the Fight sub-phase of any Assault phase (friendly or enemy) and targets the Psyker and his unit. If successful, all models gain +1 Strength until the end of that Assault phase.</p>

<h3><strong>Sanctuary - Warp Charge 1</strong></h3>

<p>Sanctuary is a <strong>blessing</strong> that is used at the start of any enemy Assault phase and targets the Psyker. If successful, all enemy models that attempt to charge the Psyker, or a friendly unit within 12&rdquo; of the Psyker, treat all ground (including open terrain) as both difficult and dangerous terrain.</p>

<h3><strong>Dark Excommunication - Warp Charge 1</strong></h3>

<p>Dark Excommunication is a <strong>malediction</strong> that is used at the start of the Fight sub-phase in any Assault phase (friendly or enemy) and targets a single enemy unit in base contact with the Psyker. If successful, all Daemonic Gifts (see Codex: Chaos Daemons) possessed by models in the chosen unit cease to work until the end of the phase.</p>

<h3><strong>Psychic Communion - Warp Charge 1</strong></h3>

<p>Psychic Communion is a <strong>blessing</strong> that is used at the start of the Movement phase before any Reserve rolls are made.

This power is cumulative with any other modifiers to Reserve rolls, including other Psychic Communion powers.</p>

<p><strong style="color:#0000ff">*</strong> If you want to manifest this psychic power you must select a model that knows this psychic power to take the psychic test, and measure range, line of sight etc. from him. The Strength and AP of Psychic Barrage both increase by 1 for each model in the unit that knows this power after the first &ndash; only one shot is fired, regardless of the number of psykers in the squad. If a unit containing one or more models with this psychic power suffers Perils of the Warp, all models in the unit that know this Psychic Power suffer the effects.</p>
