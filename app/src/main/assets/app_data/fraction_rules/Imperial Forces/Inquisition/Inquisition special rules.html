<h1><strong>SPECIAL RULES</strong></h1>

<p><strong>Amphibious:</strong> A Chimera treats all water features as open terrain when it moves.</p>

<p><strong>Daemonbane:</strong> Any model with the Daemon or Psyker special rule that suffers one or more unsaved Wounds from a weapon with this special rule must take a Leadership test at the end of the Assault phase. If the test is passed, nothing happens. If the test is failed, the model is removed as a casualty.</p>

<h2><strong>DAEMONIC POWER (Daemonhost)</strong></h2>

<p>Roll a D6 at the start of each friendly turn for each unit that contains one or more Daemonhosts to determine which ability all the Daemonhosts in that unit manifest this turn. Unless otherwise stated, each manifestation lasts until the start of your next turn.</p>

<h3><strong>D6 &ndash; Result</strong></h3>

<p><strong>1 - Re-knit Host Form: </strong> The Daemonhosts have the Feel No Pain special rule.</p>

<p><strong>2 - Warp Grasp: </strong> In the Assault phase, each Daemonhost can attack using the following profile:</p>

<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<th>
			<p align="center"><strong>Range</strong></p>

		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

<p><strong>3 - Daemonic Speed:</strong> The Daemonhosts gain the Fleet special rule, and their Initiative increases to 10.</p>

<p><strong>4 - Warp Strength: </strong> The Daemonhosts&rsquo; Strength characteristic increases to 6.</p>

<p><strong>5 - Energy Torrent: </strong> In the Shooting phase, each Daemonhost can make a shooting attack with the following profile:</p>

<h2><strong>DAEMONIC POWERS (Daemonblade)</strong></h2>

<p>Every Daemonblade has two daemonic powers randomly generated from the following list before the army is deployed. If the same result is rolled twice, you can choose the Daemonblade&rsquo;s second daemonic power.</p>

<h3><strong>2D6 - Daemonic Power</strong></h3>

<p><strong>2-3 - Warpflame: </strong> Attacks made with the Daemonblade are resolved at +3 Strength.</p>

<p><strong>4 - Unholy Speed: </strong> The wielder has +3 Attacks.</p>

<p><strong>5 - Etherblade: </strong> The Daemonblade has an AP of 2.</p>

<p><strong>6 - Vampyre: </strong> When the Daemonblade inflicts an unsaved wound, its wielder immediately gains +1 Wound (to a maximum of 10).</p>

<p><strong>7 - Daemonic Feud: </strong> Close combat attacks from this sword always wound Daemons on a roll of 2+. Furthermore, Daemons must re-roll any successful invulnerable saves against any wounds caused by this Daemonblade.</p>

<p><strong>8 - Deathlust: </strong> The wielder of the Daemonblade has the Furious Charge and Rage special rules.</p>

<p><strong>9 - Dark Resurrection: </strong> The wielder of the Daemonblade has the Feel No Pain and Eternal Warrior special rules</p>

<p><strong>10 - Daemon Venom: </strong> The Daemonblade has the Poisoned (2+) special rule.</p>

<p><strong>11+ - Familiar: </strong> The wielder generates one additional Warp Charge point in each of his turns. In addition, the Daemonblade gains the Force special rule.</p>

<p><strong>Grav Chute Insertion: </strong> If a Valkyrie has moved more than 6&quot;, passengers may still disembark, but they must do so as follows. Nominate any point over which the Valkyrie moved that turn and deploy the unit as if it were deep striking onto that point. If the unit scatters, every model must immediately take a Dangerous Terrain test. If any of the models cannot be deployed, the unit is destroyed.</p>

<p><strong>Inconceivable Customisation: </strong> When an Inquisitorial Henchmen Warband containing one or more Jokaero is deployed, roll a D6 on the following chart. Each time you roll, add +1 to the result for each Jokaero in the unit beyond the first. All results apply for the duration of the game.</p>

<h3><strong>D6 &ndash; Result</strong></h3>

<p><strong>1 - Aesthetic Alteration: </strong> While pleasing to the Jokaero, these modifications have no noticeable effect.</p>

<p><strong>2 - Improved Gun Sights: </strong> All non-template shooting weapons in the unit have their maximum range increased by 12&quot;.</p>

<p><strong>3 - Reinforced Armour: </strong> Models in the unit treat their Armour Save as being one better than normal.</p>

<p><strong>4 - Penetrating Ammunition: </strong> All shooting weapons in the unit are Rending.</p>

<p><strong>5 - Augmentative Energy Fields: </strong> All models in the unit have a 5+ invulnerable save.</p>

<p><strong>6 - The Works: </strong> Roll twice more on the table and apply both results. Each upgrade can only be applied once &ndash; ignore duplicate results (including further rolls of 6).</p>

<p><strong>Jokaero Ingenuity: </strong> A Jokaero can have his digital weapons fire as one of the following weapons: lascannon, multi-melta or heavy flamer. Choose which when the weapon is fired. All Jokaero in the same unit must choose the same weapon.</p>

<p><strong>Mindlock: </strong> If a unit containing Servitors does not also include an Inquisitor (including Inquisitor Coteaz and Inquisitor Karamazov), it must test for Mindlock at the start of each friendly turn. To test for Mindlock, roll a D6. If the result is a 1, 2 or 3, the Servitors have succumbed to Mindlock &ndash; the unit (including any characters) may not move (though they may fall back), shoot or assault that turn (though they will fight normally in close combat if already engaged).</p>

<p><strong>Psi-shock: </strong> Any Psyker that takes an unsaved Wound from a weapon with this rule suffers the Perils of the Warp in addition to any other effects.</p>

<p><strong>Psychic Beacon: </strong> Friendly units do not scatter when they Deep Strike, so long as the first model placed is within 6&quot; of a model with this special rule. This model must have been on the battlefield at the start of the turn in order for this special rule to be used.</p>

<p><strong>Repair: </strong> If a Rhino is Immobilised, then in subsequent turns it can attempt to repair itself instead of shooting. To make the attempt, roll a D6 in the Shooting phase; on the roll of a 6, the vehicle is no longer Immobilised. Note that a successful Repair does not restore a Hull Point.</p>

<p><strong>Uncanny Reflexes: </strong> A Death Cult Assassin has a 5+ invulnerable save.</p>

<p><strong>War Hymns: </strong> A model with this special rule can take a Leadership test at the beginning of each Fight sub-phase in which he is locked in combat. If the test is successful, choose one of the following war hymns to immediately take effect.</p>

<p><strong>&bull; The Emperor Protects: </strong> The Ministorum Priest and his unit re-roll all failed armour and invulnerable saves until the end of the phase.</p>

<p><strong>&bull; The Emperor&rsquo;s Strength: </strong> The Ministorum Priest has the Smash special rule until the end of the phase.</p>

<p><strong>&bull; The Righteousness of the Emperor</strong> The Ministorum Priest and his unit reroll failed rolls To Wound until the end of the phase.</p>

<p><strong>Warp Shield: </strong> A Daemonhost has a 5+ invulnerable save.</p>

<p><strong>Witchbane:</strong> Any unsaved wounds caused by a null rod inflict Instant Death on models with the Psyker or Brotherhood of Psykers/Sorcerers special rule. Futhermore, the bearer (and his squad) cannot be targeted by psychic powers (friendly or enemy).</p>
