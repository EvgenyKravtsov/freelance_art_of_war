<h3><strong>1. Unquestionable Wisdom: </strong></h3>

<p>The Warlord and his unit can choose to pass or fail any Morale checks they are called upon to make.</p>

<h3><strong>2. Reader of the Tarot: </strong></h3>

<p>Whilst the Warlord is alive, you can roll two dice and choose the result you want when rolling for Reserves, Outflank, mysterious terrain or mysterious objectives.</p>

<h3><strong>3. Burner of Worlds: </strong></h3>

<p>Once per game, your Warlord can call down an orbital attack in his Shooting phase. This counts as firing a ranged weapon with the profile below. This does not prevent the Warlord and his unit from declaring a charge against the target unit that turn.</p>

<p><strong>Orbital: </strong> If an arrow is rolled on the scatter dice, an orbital bombardment always scatters the full 2D6&rdquo; &ndash; the Warlord&rsquo;s Ballistic Skill makes no difference.</p>

<h3><strong>4. Xeno Hunter: </strong></h3>

<p>The Warlord and his unit have the Preferred Enemy special rule when targeting any enemy non-vehicle units from the following codexes: Dark Eldar, Eldar, Necrons, Orks, Tau Empire and Tyranids.</p>

<h3><strong>5. Xenotech Collector: </strong></h3>

<p>The Warlord has a 6+ invulnerable save. In addition, select one of the Warlord&rsquo;s ranged weapons. That weapon gains +1 Strength and the Rending special rule for the duration of the battle.</p>

<h3><strong>6. Purity of Mankind: </strong></h3>

<p>The Warlord and his unit have the Hatred special rule.</p>
