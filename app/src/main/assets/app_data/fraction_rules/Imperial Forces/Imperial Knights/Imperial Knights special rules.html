<h1><strong>SPECIAL RULES</strong></h1>

<p>All Super-heavy Walkers have the following special rules:</p>

<p><strong>Fear, Hammer of Wrath, Move Through Cover, Relentless, Smash, Strikedown.</strong></p>

<h2><strong>FEAR</strong></h2>

<p>At the start of each Fight sub-phase, a unit in base contact with one or more enemy models that cause Fear must take a Leadership test (called a Fear test) before any blows are struck. If the test is passed, all is well and there is no effect. If the test is failed, the unit succumbs to fear &ndash; all models in the unit have their Weapon Skill reduced to 1 for the remainder of that Fight sub-phase. Note that some units are less prone to Fear than others. Units that contain one or more models with the And They Shall Know No Fear or Fearless special rules automatically pass Fear tests. However, a model that causes Fear is not itself immune to Fear.</p>

<h2><strong>HAMMER OF WRATH</strong></h2>

<p>If a model with this special rule charges and ends its charge move in base contact with one or more enemy models, it makes one additional Attack that hits automatically and is resolved at the model&rsquo;s unmodified Strength with an AP of &ndash;. This Attack is resolved during the Fight sub-phase at the Initiative 10 step. This does not grant the model an additional Pile In move at the Initiative 10 step. If a model with this special rule charges a Transport vehicle or building, the Hammer of Wrath hit is resolved against the Transport vehicle or building, not the occupants.</p>

<h2><strong>MOVE THROUGH COVER</strong></h2>

<p>A unit that contains at least one model with this special rule rolls an extra D6 when rolling to move through difficult terrain. In most circumstances, this will mean that the unit rolls 3D6 and picks the highest roll. Furthermore, a model with the Move Through Cover special rule automatically passes Dangerous Terrain tests. The Move Through Cover special rule has no effect on charge range rolls or Impact tests (See Warhammer 40,000 rulebook).</p>

<h2><strong>RELENTLESS</strong></h2>

<p>Relentless models can shoot with Heavy, Salvo or Ordnance weapons, counting as stationary, even if they moved in the previous Movement phase. They are also allowed to charge in the same turn they fire Heavy, Ordnance, Rapid Fire or Salvo weapons.</p>

<h2><strong>SMASH</strong></h2>

<p>All of the close combat attacks, except Hammer of Wrath Attacks, of a model with this special rule are resolved at AP 2 (unless it&rsquo;s attacking with an AP 1 weapon). Additionally, when it makes its close combat attacks, it can choose to instead make a Smash Attack. If it does so, roll To Hit as normal, but halve its Attacks characteristic. A Smash Attack also doubles the model&rsquo;s Strength (to a maximum of 10) for the purposes of that Attack. Furthermore, a model making a Smash Attack can re-roll its armour penetration rolls, but must abide by the second result.</p>

<h2><strong>STRIKEDOWN</strong></h2>

<p>Any model that suffers one or more unsaved Wounds or passes one or more saving throws against an attack with the Strikedown special rule is knocked off its feet and must get up before it can do anything else. It halves its Initiative and moves as if it is in difficult terrain until the end of its next turn. It is a good idea to mark affected models with counters or coins so that you remember. Vehicles and Monstrous Creatures are immune to the effects of Strikedown.</p>

<p><strong>Invincible Behemoth: </strong> A Super-heavy Walker is so large and strongly built that weapons which degrade the armour of smaller vehicles will not affect it. Because of this, any attack that says that the target model is destroyed, wrecked, Explodes! or is otherwise removed from play inflicts D3 Hull Points of damage on a Super-heavy Walker instead. In addition, any attacks or special abilities that permanently lower the Armour Values of a target vehicle do not affect a Super-heavy Walker. Note that attacks or abilities that count the Armour Value as being lower, but do not actually change it, work normally.</p>

<h2><strong>DESTROYER</strong></h2>

<p>Imperial Knights are armed with large and extremely destructive weapons, which means the new weapon rule below is required to represent the havoc they can wreak.</p>

<h2><strong>DESTROYER WEAPONS</strong></h2>

<p>If a weapon has a D instead of a Strength value in its profile, it means it is a Destroyer weapon. To resolve a Destroyer weapon&rsquo;s attack, roll To Hit as you would for a standard attack. If the attack hits, roll on the table below instead of rolling To Wound or for armour penetration. No saving throws of any kind are allowed against damage from a Destroyer weapon, including special rolls such as Feel No Pain or Necron Reanimation Protocols.</p>
