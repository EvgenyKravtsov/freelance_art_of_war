<h1><strong>SPECIAL RULES</strong></h1>

<h2><strong>SUPER-HEAVY WALKER</strong></h2>

<p>An Imperial Knight is a type of vehicle known as a Super-heavy Walker. Super-heavy Walkers follow all of the rules for Walkers as defined in the Warhammer 40,000 rulebook, with the additional rules and exceptions given below.</p>

<h2><strong>MOVEMENT</strong></h2>

<p>Super-heavy Walkers can move 12&rdquo; in the Movement phase unless specified otherwise. Apart from this, they obey the movement rules for Walkers.</p>

<h2><strong>SHOOTING</strong></h2>

<p>When a Super-heavy Walker makes a shooting attack, it may fire each of its weapons at different targets if desired. In addition, firing Ordnance weapons has no effect on a Superheavy Walker&rsquo;s ability to fire other weapons. Note, however, that Super-heavy Walkers may not fire Overwatch.</p>

<h2><strong>VEHICLE DAMAGE</strong></h2>

<p>A Super-heavy Walker is so large, and has such formidable damage control systems, that the effects of Crew Shaken, Crew Stunned, Immobilised or Weapon Destroyed results are ignored. In addition, each time a Super-heavy Walker suffers an Explodes! result on the Vehicle Damage table, it loses D3 additional Hull Points instead of suffering the effects listed.</p>

<p>Note that Super-heavy Walkers still lose a Hull Point for each glancing or penetrating hit; it is just the results on the Vehicle Damage Table that are modified (see the Super-heavy Walker Vehicle Damage table below).</p>
