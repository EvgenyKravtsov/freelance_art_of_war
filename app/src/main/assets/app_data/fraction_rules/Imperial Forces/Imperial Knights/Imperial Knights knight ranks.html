<h2><strong>KNIGHT ARMIES</strong></h2>

<p>You may take an army where the primary detachment is made up of three to six Imperial Knights. If you do so, then the detachment must include a Knight Warlord (see below). No other restrictions apply. Other detachments, such as additional primary detachments, allied detachments or fortifications, can be taken normally. In an Imperial Knight army, all Imperial Knights are scoring units.</p>

<h2><strong>KNIGHTLY RANKS</strong></h2>

<p>Players that want to include Knights Apparent or Seneschals in their games must roll a dice for each of their Knights Errant or Knights Paladin (other than their Warlord) at the same time as they determine Warlord Traits, and refer to the Knightly Rank table below to see what rank that Knight has.</p>

<h2><strong>KNIGHTLY RANK TABLE</strong></h2>

<h3><strong>D6 Rank</strong></h3>

<p><strong>1 Knight Apparent: </strong> Subtract 1 from the Knight&rsquo;s Weapon Skill and Ballistic Skill. In addition, A Knight Apparent&rsquo;s ion shield confers a 5+ invulnerable save instead of the normal 4+.</p>

<p><strong>2-5 Knight: </strong> The standard game rules apply.</p>

<p><strong>6 Seneschal: </strong> Add 1 to the Knight&rsquo;s Weapon Skill and Ballistic Skill. In addition, A Knight Seneschal&rsquo;s ion shield confers a 3+ invulnerable save instead of the normal 4+.</p>

<h2><strong>KNIGHT WARLORDS</strong></h2>

<p>If you are fielding an army where the primary detachment is made up of Imperial Knights, one Knight must be nominated as the Knight Warlord for the army. A Knight Warlord always has the rank of Seneschal (see the Knightly Rank table above). In addition, they receive a Warlord Trait rolled for on the Imperial Knights Warlord Traits table.</p>
