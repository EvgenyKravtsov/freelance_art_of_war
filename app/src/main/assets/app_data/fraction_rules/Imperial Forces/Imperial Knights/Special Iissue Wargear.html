<p><strong>&nbsp;ION SHIELD&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>When an &nbsp;Imperial Knight is deployed, and subsequently at the start of each of the opposing side's Shooting phases before any attacks are carried out, the controlling player must declare which facing each Imperial Knight's ion shield is covering. The choices are: front, left side, right side, rear. The Knight has 4+ invulnerable save against all hits onthat facing jntill the start of your opponent's next Shooting phase. Ion shields are repositioned before any attacks are carried out in the Shooting phase. Ion shields cannot be use against close combat attacks.</p>

<p></p>

<p><em>Q: How do you determine which side of an Imperial Knight is hit by a Barrage weapon (which are always resolved against a vehicle’s side armour) for the purposes of determining if the Knight gets an ion shield save?</em></p>

<p>A: Use the direction of the firing model to determine the facing of the attack for the purposes of the Knight’s ion shield, but resolve the attack against its side armour as normal.</p>

<p><em>Q: How does the Wall of Mirrors special rule of the Tau’s Optimised Stealth Cadre Formation interact with an Imperial Knight’s ion shield?</em></p>

<p>A: Use the direction of the firing model to determine the facing of the attack for the purposes of the Knight’s ion shield, but resolve the attack against its rear armour as normal.</p>
