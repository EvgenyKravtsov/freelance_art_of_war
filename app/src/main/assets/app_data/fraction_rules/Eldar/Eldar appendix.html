<h1><strong>APPENDIX</strong></h1>

<p><strong>This section of the book details many of the rules for using an army of craftworld Eldar in your games of Warhammer 40,000, including their unique Warlord Traits, wargear and Tactical Objectives. The profiles page at the end provides a list of unit and weapons profiles for reference during your games.</strong></p>

<h2><strong>ARMY SPECIAL RULES</strong></h2>

<p>A craftworld Eldar army uses a number of special rules that are common to several of its units, which are collected here for your convenience. Special rules that are unique to particular units are presented in the relevant unit entry instead. Other, more common rules are simply listed by name &ndash; these are all described in full in the Special Rules section of Warhammer 40,000: The Rules.</p>

<h2><strong>ANCIENT DOOM</strong></h2>

<p>A model with this special rule has the Hatred special rule against Daemons of Slaanesh or models with the Mark of Slaanesh. Furthermore, when making Fear tests, a unit containing at least one model with this special rule suffers a -1 penalty to its Leadership if it is engaged in combat with a unit that contains at least one model with the Mark of Slaanesh or the Daemon of Slaanesh special rule.</p>

<h2><strong>BATTLE FOCUS</strong></h2>

<p>A unit composed entirely of models with the Battle Focus special rule can either shoot and then Run, or Run and then shoot, in the same Shooting phase. The unit must complete both actions before you move onto the next unit &ndash; otherwise the chance to make the second action is forfeit. A model cannot Run if it fired a Heavy weapon during the same Shooting phase unless it has the Relentless special rule. Similarly, a model that has Run cannot then fire a Heavy weapon in the same Shooting phase unless it has the Relentless special rule. Models that cannot Run gain no benefit from the Battle Focus special rule.</p>

<h2><strong>WARLORD TRAITS</strong></h2>

<p>When generating Warlord Traits for a Warlord with the Eldar Faction, you can either roll on one of the Warlord Traits tables in Warhammer 40,000: The Rules or roll on the table below.</p>
