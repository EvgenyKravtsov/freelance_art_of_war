<h1><strong>RUNES OF FATE </strong></h1>

<h2><strong>PRIMARIS POWER</strong></h2>

<h3><strong>GUIDE - WARP CHARGE 1</strong></h3>

<p>Guide is a <strong>blessing</strong> that targets a single friendly unit within 24&quot;. Whilst the power is in effect, the target unit can re-roll all failed To Hit rolls when shooting.</p>

<h3><strong>1. EXECUTIONER - WARP CHARGE 1 </strong></h3>

<p>Executioner is a <strong>focussed witchfire</strong> power with a range of 24&quot;. The target suffers 3 hits, resolved at the Psyker&rsquo;s Strength with the Fleshbane special rule and AP-. If the target is removed from play as a result, another model in the same unit suffers 2 hits as described above. If the second target is slain, a third and final model in the same unit suffers 1 hit as described above.</p>

<p>If the Psyker chose the first target model, he can choose the second and third target models. If the first target model was chosen randomly, then the second and third target models must also be chosen randomly. If at any point a target survives, or there are no models left in the target&rsquo;s unit, the power&rsquo;s effects end.</p>

<h3><strong>2. DOOM - WARP CHARGE 2 </strong></h3>

<p>Doom is a <strong>malediction</strong> that targets a single enemy unit within 24&quot;. If the target is a nonvehicle unit, all failed To Wound rolls made against the target can be re-rolled whilst this power is in effect. If the target is a vehicle, all failed Armour Penetration rolls made against it can be re-rolled whilst this power is in effect.</p>

<h3><strong>3. WILL OF ASURYAN ...WARP CHARGE 2</strong></h3>

<p>Will of Asuryan is a <strong>blessing</strong> that targets the Psyker. Whilst the power is in effect, the Psyker and all friendly units within 12&quot; of the Psyker have the Fearless and Adamantium Will special rules.</p>

<h3><strong>4. FORTUNE - WARP CHARGE 2 </strong></h3>

<p>Fortune is a <strong>blessing</strong> that targets a single friendly unit within 24&quot;. Whilst the power is in effect, the target can re-roll all failed saving throws and Deny the Witch rolls.</p>

<h3><strong>5. MIND WAR - WARP CHARGE 2</strong></h3>

<p>Mind War is a <strong>focussed witchfire</strong> power with a range of 24&quot;. Both the Psyker and the target model roll a D6 and add their respective Leadership values. If the scores are drawn, the target model suffers a -1 penalty to its Weapon Skill and Ballistic Skill until the end of the following turn. If the Psyker&rsquo;s score is higher, the target also suffers a number of Wounds equal to the difference between the two scores. No armour or cover saves are allowed against Wounds caused by Mind War.</p>

<h3><strong>6. ELDRITCH STORM - WARP CHARGE 3 or 4</strong></h3>

<p>Each time this psychic power is used, choose whether it will have a Warp Charge cost of 3 or 4. This choice must be made before the Psychic test is taken. Eldritch Storm is a witchfire power with the following profiles; it uses the first if it is manifested at Warp Charge 3, and the second if it is manifested at Warp Charge 4.</p>
