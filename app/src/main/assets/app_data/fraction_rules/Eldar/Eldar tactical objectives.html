<h1><strong>TACTICAL OBJECTIVES</strong></h1>

<p><strong>Codex: Craftworlds describes six Tactical Objectives to use in your games that are exclusive to Eldar players and reflect the discipline and skill of their warhosts in battle.</strong></p>

<p>If your Warlord has the Eldar Faction, these Tactical Objectives replace the Capture &amp; Control Tactical Objectives (numbers 11-16) described in Warhammer 40,000: The Rules.</p>

<p>If a Warhammer 40,000 mission has the Tactical Objectives special rule, players use the normal rules for using Tactical Objectives with the following exception: when an Eldar player generates a Capture &amp; Control objective (numbers 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 or 16), the Eldar player instead generates the corresponding Eldar Tactical Objective, as shown in the table (below). Other Tactical Objectives (numbers 21-66) are generated normally.</p>

<h2><strong>11. LEGACY OF SORROW</strong></h2>

<p><em><strong>By slaying the enemy leader now, a potential disaster in the years to come can be averted.</strong></em></p>

<p>Score 1 Victory Point at the end of your turn if an enemy character was removed as a casualty during this turn.</p>

<h2><strong>12 SKYBORNE ASSAULT</strong></h2>

<p><em><strong>It is the birthright of the Eldar to strike with the fury of the storm, asserting their rule over stars and skies alike.</strong></em></p>

<p>Score 1 Victory Point at the end of your turn if, during your turn, at least one enemy unit was completely destroyed by a friendly unit with the Eldar Faction and the Skimmer or Eldar Jetbike unit type. If 3 or more enemy units were completely destroyed by a friendly unit with the Eldar Faction and the Skimmer or Eldar Jetbike unit type, score D3 Victory Points instead.</p>

<h2><strong>13 KHAINES&rsquo;S WRATH</strong></h2>

<p><em><strong>Just as there is a time for subtlety and finesse, there is a time for unfettered rage and destruction.</strong></em></p>

<p>Score 1 Victory Point at the end of your turn if, during your turn, a friendly unit with the Eldar Faction successfully charged an enemy unit. If 3 or more friendly units with the Eldar Faction made successful charges, score D3 points instead.</p>

<h2><strong>14 GUARDIANS OF THE HIDDEN PATH</strong></h2>

<p><em><strong>Dormant though it may be, a conduit to the webway cannot be allowed to fall into enemy hands.</strong></em></p>

<p>Roll a D6 when this Tactical Objective is generated. Score 1 Victory Point at the end of your turn if there are no enemy units within 12&quot; of the Objective Marker whose number corresponds to the result of the D6.</p>

<h2><strong>15 STRANDS OF FATE</strong></h2>

<p><em><strong>The myriad futures of a battle are ever in flux, but it is within the abilities of a gifted seer to edge them in his favour by being in the right place at the right time.</strong></em></p>

<p>Roll a D6 when this Tactical Objective is generated. Immediately after rolling the D6, you can increase or decrease the result by 1 if your Warlord has the Psyker special rule. Score 1 Victory Point at the end of your turn if you control the Objective Marker whose number corresponds to the result.</p>

<h2><strong>16 COMBINED STRIKE</strong></h2>

<p><em><strong>A well-coordinated attack is a symphony of destruction, warriors working together to become more than the sum of their parts.</strong></em></p>

<p>Score 1 Victory Point at the end of your turn if at least one enemy unit was completely destroyed during either your Psychic, Shooting or Assault phase. Score D3 Victory Points instead if at least one enemy unit was completely destroyed in any two of these phases. Score D3+3 Victory Points instead if at least one enemy unit was destroyed in all three of these phases.</p>
