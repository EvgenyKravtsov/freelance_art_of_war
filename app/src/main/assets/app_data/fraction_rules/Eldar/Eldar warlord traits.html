<h1><strong>WARLORD TRAITS TABLE</strong></h1>

<h2><strong>D6 WARLORD TRAIT</strong></h2>

<p><strong>Ambush of Blades: </strong> The Warlord&#39;s uncanny senses pierce the fog of war. Knowing the precise time at which to strike, he commands his kin to level a storm of blades, energy blasts and razor-edged shuriken into the foe</p>

<p>One use only. Declare your Warlord is using this ability at the start of one of your Shooting or Assault phases. For the duration of the phase, the Warlord and all friendly units with the Eldar Faction within 12&quot; of him re-roll To Wound rolls of 1.</p>

<p><strong>An Eye on Distant Events: </strong> The Warlord&#39;s well-honed survival instincts allow him to use every advantage of the battlefield for the betterment of his plan, sending his warriors stalking silently toward the enemy&#39;s lines.</p>

<p>Choose up to D3 units in your army. These units gain the Scout special rule.</p>

<p><strong>Falcon&#39;s Swiftness: </strong>The Warlord, and those who travel in his wake, move across broken ruins and blasted battlefields with an astonishing certainty and agility as they close with those they hunt.</p>

<p>The Warlord and his unit add 3 to the dice roll when determining how far they can Run (this will normally be D6+3&quot;).</p>

<p><strong>Fate&#39;s Messenger: </strong> The strands of fate coil and twist around the Warlord, the paths of destiny manipulated to keep him from harm so that he might strike back at his foes.</p>

<p>The Warlord re-rolls all saving throw results of 1.</p>

<p><strong>Mark of the Incomparable Hunter: </strong> The Warlord is a skilled hunter and a master marksman. He places his shots precisely where they are most needed, each kill tipping the course of the battle to his advantage.</p>

<p>The Warlord has the Split Fire special rule.</p>

<p><strong>Seer of the Shifting Vector: </strong> The Warlord is wise enough to read the skeins of destiny, seeing the many possible futures amid the mayhem of combat to better coordinate his reinforcements.</p>

<p>Friendly units with the Eldar Faction arriving by Deep Strike do not scatter as long as the first model placed is within 12&quot; of the Warlord.</p>
