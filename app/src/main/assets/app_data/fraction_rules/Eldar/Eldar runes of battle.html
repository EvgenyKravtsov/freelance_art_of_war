<h1><strong>RUNES OF BATTLE</strong></h1>

<p><strong>The incredible discipline of the craftworld Eldar makes them amongst the most formidable psykers in the galaxy. They bring myriad powers to the battlefield, from those that subtly manipulate reality to raw destructive forces.</strong></p>

<p>Note that to represent the Eldar&rsquo;s prodigious psychic abilities, an Eldar Psyker that generates a power from the Runes of Battle will have access to not one but two separate abilities. When using one of these psychic powers, choose which ability the Psyker is attempting to use before making the psychic test.</p>

<h2><strong>PRIMARIS POWER</strong></h2>

<h3><strong>CONCEAL/REVEAL - WARP CHARGE 1</strong></h3>

<p>Conceal is a <strong>blessing</strong> that targets the Psyker. Whilst the power is in effect, the Psyker has the Shrouded special rule.</p>

<p>Reveal is a <strong>malediction</strong> that targets a single enemy unit within 18&quot;. Whilst the power is in effect, all models in the target unit lose the Stealth and Shrouded special rules.</p>

<h3><strong>1. DESTRUCTOR/RENEWER ...WARP CHARGE 1</strong></h3>
