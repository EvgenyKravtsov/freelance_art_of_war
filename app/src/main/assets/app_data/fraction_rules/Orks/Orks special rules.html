<p><strong>Codex: Orks details a unique Detachment &ndash; the Ork Horde Detachment &ndash; that reflects the horde-like nature of the greenskins. This follows all the Detachment rules presented in Warhammer 40,000: The Rules.</strong></p>

<h1><strong>Restrictions</strong></h1>

<p>All units in this Detachment must have the Orks Faction (or have no Faction).</p>

<h1><strong>Command Benefits</strong></h1>

<p><strong>Boss of Da Waaagh!: </strong> If this Detachment is chosen as your Primary Detachment, you can re-roll the result when rolling on the Warlord Traits table in Codex: Orks.</p>

<p><strong>The Greenskin Hordes: </strong> Every unit with 10 or more models in this Detachment gains the Hammer of Wrath special rule in any Assault phase in which it successfully charges an enemy unit and the dice rolled for its charge range is 10 or more(before modifiers). Note that the unit does not need to move the full distance rolled to gain this effect and it does not matter if the unit&rsquo;s size is reduced below 10 models during its charge (as a result of Overwatch, Dangerous Terrain tests etc.) so long as it can still successfully make the charge.</p>
