<h1><strong>&rsquo;Ere We Go!</strong></h1>

<p>If every model in a unit has this special rule, the unit can re-roll a single dice when determining its charge range.</p>

<h1><strong>Mob Rule</strong></h1>

<p>If every model in a unit has this special rule, and the unit fails a Morale check or Pinning test (after any re-rolls they may have), roll immediately on the following table:</p>

<h1><strong>D6 Result</strong></h1>

<h3><strong>1 Born to Fight: </strong></h3>

<p>If the unit is locked in combat, it is treated as if it had passed the Morale check or Pinning test. If the unit is not locked in combat, it fails the Morale check or Pinning test.</p>

<h3><strong>2-3 Breaking Heads:</strong></h3>

<p>If the unit includes one or more Ork characters (including Independent Characters), it suffers D6 Strength 4 AP- hits, and is then treated as if it had passed the Morale check or Pinning test. These hits are Randomly Allocated, but cannot be allocated to Ork characters (any excess hits are lost). If the unit does not include any Ork characters, it fails the Morale check or Pinning test.</p>

<h3><strong>4-6 Squabble:</strong></h3>

<p>If the unit has 10 or more models, it suffers D6 Strength 4 AP- hits, and is then treated as if it had passed the Morale check or Pinning test. The hits are Randomly Allocated. If the unit has fewer than 10 models, it fails the Morale check or Pinning test.</p>
