<p><strong>Rules for the following grenades can be found in Warhammer 40,000: The Rules:</strong></p>

<p>Stikkbombs*</p>

<p>* See assault grenades</p>

<p>Tankbusta bombs**</p>

<p>** See melta bombs</p>

<h2><strong>Bosspole</strong></h2>

<p>Each time a unit that includes at least one model with a Bosspole rolls on the Mob Rule table, you may choose to re-roll any result other than a Breaking Heads result. You must accept the result of the re-roll.</p>

<h2><strong>Cybork Body</strong></h2>

<p>A model with a cybork body has the Feel No Pain (6+) special rule.</p>

<h2><strong>Dok&rsquo;s Tools</strong></h2>

<p>As long as the bearer is alive, all models in his unit have the Feel No Pain special rule.</p>

<h2><strong>Gitfinda</strong></h2>

<p>A model with a gitfinda that remained stationary during its Movement phase has Ballistic Skill 3 until the end of its turn.</p>

<h2><strong>Kustom Force Field</strong></h2>

<p>The bearer, and all models within 6&quot;, receive a 5+ invulnerable save against any shooting attacks. If the bearer is embarked in a vehicle, then the vehicle receives a 5+ invulnerable save against any shooting attacks instead.</p>

<h2><strong>Mek&rsquo;s Tools</strong></h2>

<p>In each of your Shooting phases, instead of firing his weapons, a model equipped with Mek&rsquo;s tools may choose to repair a single friendly vehicle that he is in base contact with or embarked upon. To repair a vehicle, roll a D6. If the result is 5 or more, you may either restore a Hull Point lost earlier in the battle or repair a Weapon Destroyed result or an Immobilised result instead; this is effective immediately.</p>

<h2><strong>Rokkit Pack</strong></h2>

<p>Rokkit Pack Models equipped with rokkit packs gain the Jump unit type as described in Warhammer 40,000: The Rules. A unit made up exclusively of models with rokkit packs can choose to use them to Run 2D6&quot; in the Shooting phase instead of the normal D6&quot; even if it used them in the Movement phase. If it does so, every model in the unit must take a Dangerous Terrain test.</p>

<h2><strong>Waaagh! Banner </strong></h2>

<p>All models in a unit that includes a Waaagh! Banner add +1 to the Weapon Skill characteristic on their profile.</p>

<h2><strong>Warbike</strong></h2>

<p>A model equipped with a warbike changes their unit type to Bike, as described in Warhammer 40,000: The Rules. In addition, they have a 4+ Armour Save. Furthermore, if a model on a warbike turbo-boosts, it counts its cover save as being 1 point higher than normal until the start of its next turn. Warbikes are fitted with a twin-linked dakkagun.</p>
