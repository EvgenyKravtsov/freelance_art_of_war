<p>If your Warlord has the Orks Faction, these Tactical Objectives replace the Capture &amp; Control Tactical Objectives (numbers 11-16) described in Warhammer 40,000: The Rules.</p>

<p>If a Warhammer 40,000 mission has the Tactical Objectives special rule, players use the normal rules for using Tactical Objectives (see Warhammer 40,000: The Rules) with the following exception: when an Ork player generates a Capture &amp; Control objective (numbers 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 or 16), the Ork player instead generates the corresponding Ork Tactical Objective, as shown in the table below.</p>

<p>Other Tactical Objectives (numbers 21-66) are generated normally, as described in Warhammer 40,000: The Rules.</p>

<h1><strong>11 MORE DAKKA!</strong></h1>

<p>Score 1 Victory Point at the end of your turn if at least one enemy unit was completely destroyed during your Shooting phase.</p>

<h1><strong>12 GET &rsquo;EM BOSS!</strong></h1>

<p>Score 1 Victory Point at the end of your turn if your Warlord killed an opponent in a challenge during your turn. If your Warlord killed the enemy&rsquo;s Warlord in a challenge during your turn, score D3 Victory points instead.</p>

<h1><strong>13 STOMP &rsquo;EM, BOYZ!</strong></h1>

<p>Score 1 Victory Point at the end of your turn if at least one enemy unit was completely destroyed during your Assault phase. If 3 to 5 enemy units were completely destroyed during your Assault phase, score D3 Victory Points instead. If 6 or more enemy units were completely destroyed during your Assault phase, score D3+3 Victory Points instead.</p>

<h1><strong>14 MORE SPEED, GO FASTA!</strong></h1>

<p>Score 1 Victory Point at the end of your turn if at least three Ork units Turbo-boosted, went Flat Out or Ran 6&quot; or more during your turn.</p>

<h1><strong>15 GRAB DA LOOT!</strong></h1>

<p>Roll a D6 when this Tactical Objective is generated. Score 1 Victory Point at the end of your turn if you control the Objective Marker whose number corresponds to the D6 result.</p>

<h1><strong>16 &rsquo;ERE WE GO! WAAAGH!</strong></h1>

<p>Score 1 Victory Point at the end of your turn if, during that turn, you successfully charged an enemy unit with an Ork unit and the dice rolled for its charge distance was 10 or more (before modifiers). If, during your turn, 3 or more Ork units did this, score D3 Victory Points instead. Note that the Ork units do not need to move the full distance rolled to score this</p>
