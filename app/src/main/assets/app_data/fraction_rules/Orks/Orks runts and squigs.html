<h1><strong>RUNTS &amp; SQUIGS</strong></h1>

<p>Runts and squigs are upgrades that may be taken by certain models in an Ork army. The upgrade is either represented on the model itself, or by a suitable model placed beside the model with the upgrade. Runt and squig models are purely decorative and are always ignored for game purposes &ndash; just move them to one side if they get in the way. If the runt or squig model represents a one use only effect, remove the model once it has been used.</p>

<h1><strong>Ammo Runt</strong></h1>

<p>One use only. A model with an ammo runt can re-roll one To Hit roll when shooting.</p>

<h1><strong>Attack Squig</strong></h1>

<p>A model with an attack squig is allowed to re-roll one To Hit roll in close combat each turn.</p>

<h1><strong>Bomb Squig</strong></h1>

<p>One use only. A model with a bomb squig can make a Shooting attack using the following profile. Bomb squigs cannot be used to make Snap Shots, and cannot be used to attack Flyers, Flying Monstrous Creatures, or Skimmers.</p>

<p><strong>Scuttle Scuttle Blam!: </strong> Bomb squigs always hit the target on a To Hit roll of 2 or more.</p>

<h1><strong>Grot Oiler</strong></h1>

<p>One use only. A grot oiler allows a Mek to re-roll a failed Mek&rsquo;s Tools repair roll.</p>

<h1><strong>Grot Orderly</strong></h1>

<p>One use only. A grot orderly allows a Painboy&rsquo;s unit to re-roll a single Feel No Pain roll.</p>

<h1><strong>Squig Hound</strong></h1>

<p>Each time a unit with a squig hound fails a Morale check it suffers D6 Strength 3 AP- hits and must then re-roll the failed Morale check. If the re-roll is failed, it cannot be re-rolled again, and the squig hound will not inflict any further hits.</p>
