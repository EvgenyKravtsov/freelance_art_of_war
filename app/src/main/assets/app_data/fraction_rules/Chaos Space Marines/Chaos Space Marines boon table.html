<p><strong>11-16 Unworthy Offering: </strong> The champion receives no reward. Better luck next time!</p>

<p><strong>21-22 Spawnhood: </strong> The champion is transformed into a Chaos Spawn. Place a spare Chaos Spawn model, on full Wounds, within 3&quot; of the champion (or the vehicle in which he is embarked) and more than 1&quot; from enemy models. Then, remove the champion model from play. If the Chaos Spawn cannot be placed, just remove the champion. The champion only counts as killed once this Chaos Spawn is removed as a casualty, or if it cannot be placed on the board. The champion is now a separate, unengaged, non-scoring unit that retains none of the champion&rsquo;s special rules or wargear. It does, however, retain the same mark of Chaos (if it had one). If the champion was your Warlord, this Chaos Spawn remains your Warlord but loses his Warlord Trait.</p>

<p><strong>23 Warp Frenzy: </strong> The champion has +1 Attack.</p>

<p><strong>24 Fragment of lmmortality: </strong> The champion has the Eternal Warrior special rule.</p>

<p><strong>33 Crystalline Body: </strong> The champion has +1 Toughness.</p>

<p><strong>34 Shield of Force: </strong> The champion has the Shrouded special rule.</p>

<p><strong>35 Mechanoid: </strong> The champion&#39;s Armour Save improves by 1.</p>

<p><strong>36 Blade of Chaos: </strong> If he has one, choose one of the champion&#39;s Melee Weapons - it now has the Fleshbane special rule.</p>

<p><strong>41 Witch-eater: </strong> When the champion or his unit pass a Deny the Witch roll, the enemy Psyker immediately takes a S6, AP2 hit.</p>

<p><strong>42 Cosmic Fate: </strong> The champion may re-roll failed armour saves.</p>

<p><strong>43 Venomous: </strong> The champion&#39;s Melee attacks have the Poisoned special rule.</p>

<p><strong>44 Unholy Crusader: </strong> The champion has the Crusader special rule.</p>

<p><strong>45 Meteoric Charge: </strong> The champion has the Hammer of Wrath special rule.</p>

<p><strong>46 Icy Aura: </strong> Enemy models in base contact with the champion at the end of Initiative Step 1 take a S4, AP5 hit.</p>

<p><strong>51 Mind of Metal: </strong> The champion has the Adamantium Will special rule.</p>

<p><strong>52 Gun Morph: </strong> If he has one, choose one of the champion&#39;s ranged Weapons - it now has +1 Strength (this applies to both weapons on a combi-weapon).</p>

<p><strong>53 All-consuming Hatred: </strong> The champion has the Hatred special rule.</p>

<p><strong>64 Multiple Boons: </strong> Roll another D3+1 times on this table, re-rolling Spawnhood and Dark Apotheosis results.</p>

<p><strong>65-66 Dark Apotheosis: </strong> The champion is transformed into a Daemon Prince equipped with power armour. This follows the rules for Spawnhood (see result 21-22) with the following exceptions:</p>

<p>&bull; In every instance, replace the words &quot;Chaos Spawn&quot; with &quot;Daemon Prince&quot;.</p>

<p>&bull; If the champion had a Mark of Chaos, the Daemon Prince is instead a Daemon of the same Chaos god.</p>

<p>&bull; If the champion was your Warlord, he retains his Warlord Trait.</p>
