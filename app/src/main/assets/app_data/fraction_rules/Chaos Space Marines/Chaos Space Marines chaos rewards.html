<h3><strong>AURA OF DARK GLORY</strong></h3>

<p>A model with an aura of dark glory has a 5+ invulnerable save.</p>

<h3><strong>COMBAT FAMILIAR</strong></h3>

<p>A model with a combat familiar makes two additional Strength 4 AP- Melee Attacks. The combat familiar is always assumed to be on the same base as its master. If you wish to represent it separately you can. However, the model itself plays no part in the game; if the model gets in the way, simply move it to one side.</p>

<h3><strong>GIFT OF MUTATION</strong></h3>

<p>Before deployment, roll on the Chaos Boon table and mark the result on your army roster. Do not apply any Spawn hood or Dark Apotheosis results; roll again on the table instead. The model has that result for the entire game.</p>

<h3><strong>ICHOR BLOOD</strong></h3>

<p>Any unit that causes one or more unsaved Wounds on a model with ichor blood during the Fight sub-phase immediately takes a Strength 3 AP4 hit per Wound caused.</p>

<h3><strong>SPELL FAMILIAR</strong></h3>

<p>A model with a spell familiar may re-roll failed Psychic tests. The spell familiar is always assumed to be on the same base as its master. If you wish to represent it separately you can. However, the model itself plays no part in the game; if the model gets in the way, simply move it to one side.</p>
