<h2>Warlord Traits</h2>

<h3>1. Unholy Firebrand</h3>

<p>Your Warlord has the Zealot special rule. If your Warlord already has the Zealot special rule, then he and any models affected by his Zealot special rule can re-roll all failed To Hit rolls in every round of close combat, not just the first.</p>

<h3>2. Latent Powers</h3>

<p>Your Warlord has the Psyker (Mastery Level 1) special rule, and can generate his powers from the Daemonology (Malefic) discipline. If your Warlord is already a Psyker, add 1 to his Mastery Level instead.</p>

<h3>3. The Voice of Lorgar</h3>

<p>At the start of each of your turns, pick one of the following special rules to bestow upon a single unit from a Word Bearers Detachment or Formation that is within 12" of your Warlord: Counter-attack, Fearless, Furious Charge, Relentless. The&nbsp;unit you pick gains that special rule until the start of your next turn.</p>

<h3>4. Unbreakable Devotion</h3>

<p>Your Warlord has the Adamantium Will and Fearless special rules.</p>

<h3>5. Nexus of the Gods</h3>

<p>If your Warlord, or a friendly model within 12" of him, earns a roll on the Chaos Boon table, you can add one to or subtract one from the second dice of your D66 roll, to a maximum of 6 and a minimum of 1.</p>

<h3>6. Unexpected Boon</h3>

<p>Your Warlord can immediately make a roll on the Chaos Boon table, re-rolling any results of 11-22.</p>
