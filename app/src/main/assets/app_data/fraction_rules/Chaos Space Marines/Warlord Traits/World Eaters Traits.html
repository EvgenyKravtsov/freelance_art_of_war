<h2>Warlord Traits</h2>

<h3>1. Arch-slaughterer</h3>

<p>The Warlord has the Rampage special rule.</p>

<h3>2. Slaughterborn</h3>

<p>Each time your Warlord could roll on the Chaos Boon table (including for the Gift of Mutation Chaos Reward), you may instead choose to increase his Attacks characteristic by 1.</p>

<h3>3. Unrivalled Battlelust</h3>

<p>At the end of your opponent's Charge sub-phase you can declare a charge with your Warlord and his unit, so long as the enemy unit that you attempt to charge is locked in combat. Your Warlord and his unit count as charging for all rules purposes.</p>

<h3>4. Disciple of Khorne</h3>

<p>Your Warlord can re-roll all failed To Hit and To Wound rolls when fighting in a challenge.</p>

<h3>5. True Berzerker</h3>

<p>Whilst locked in combat, your Warlord has the Eternal Warrior and Feel No Pain special rules.</p>

<h3>6. Violent Urgency</h3>

<p>When determinating the charge range of your Warlord and any friendly units with the Mark of Khorne within 8" of&nbsp;him at the start of the Charge sub-phase, roll three dice and pick the two highest results.&nbsp;</p>
