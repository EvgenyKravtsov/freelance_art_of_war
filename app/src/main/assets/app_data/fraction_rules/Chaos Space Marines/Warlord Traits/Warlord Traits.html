<p><strong>When generating his Warlord Traits, a Chaos Warlord may either roll on one of the Warlord Traits tables in the Warhammer 40,000 rulebook, or roll on the table below.</strong></p>

<h2><strong>D6 WARLORD TRAIT</strong></h2>

<h3><strong>1 Black Crusader: </strong></h3>

<p>The Warlord and all friendly units within 12" of the Warlord have the Preferred Enemy (Space Marines) special rule.</p>

<h3><strong>2 Flames of Spite: </strong></h3>

<p>All Melee weapons belonging to the Warlord and his unit have the Soul Blaze special rule.</p>

<h3><strong>3 Master of Deception: </strong></h3>

<p>Nominate up to D3 Infantry units in your army before deployment. Those units gain the Infiltrate special rule.</p>

<h3><strong>4 Hatred Incarnate:</strong></h3>

<p>The Warlord and his unit have the Hatred special rule.</p>

<h3><strong>5 Lord of Terror: </strong></h3>

<p>The Warlord has the Fear special rule.</p>
