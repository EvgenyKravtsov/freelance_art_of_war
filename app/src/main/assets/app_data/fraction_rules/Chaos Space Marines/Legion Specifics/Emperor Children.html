<h3>EMPEROR’S CHILDREN SPECIAL RULES</h3>

<p>Any Detachment with the Chaos Space Marines Faction can be<br>
from one of the nine Traitor Legions. An Emperor’s Children<br>
Detachment retains the Chaos Space Marines Faction and is<br>
treated in all ways as a Chaos Space Marines Detachment, with<br>
the following modi<br>
cations:<br>
• They cannot include any Unique units other than Lucius<br>
the Eternal.<br>
• Units that can take the Mark of Slaanesh must do so.<br>
• Units with a Mark of Chaos other than the Mark of Slaanesh<br>
cannot be taken.<br>
• All units that can do so must be upgraded to Veterans of the<br>
Long War, at no additional points cost.<br>
• Any Daemon Princes must have the Daemon of Slaanesh<br>
special rule.<br>
• Psykers from the Detachment can choose to generate all of<br>
their psychic powers from the Discipline of Slaanesh.</p>

<p>All units in an Emperor’s Children Detachment or Formation<br>
gain the following special rules:</p>

<h4>FUELLED BY SENSATION</h4>

<p>Units that have the Veterans of the Long War special rule have<br>
the Fearless and Feel No Pain (6+) special rules (units with an<br>
Icon of Excess instead have the Fearless and Feel No Pain (4+)<br>
special rules).<br>
In addition, if a model that has the Veterans of the Long War<br>
special rule is slain in the Fight sub-phase before it has made<br>
any Attacks that phase, it can make a single Attack at the end of<br>
the current Initiative step before being removed as a casualty.</p>

<h4>MASTERS OF THE KAKOPHONI</h4>

<p>Units of Noise Marines are Troops choices instead of<br>
Elites choices</p>
