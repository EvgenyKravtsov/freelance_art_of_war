<h3>NIGHT LORDS SPECIAL RULES</h3>

<p>Any Detachment with the Chaos Space Marines Faction<br>
can be from one of the nine Traitor Legions. A Night Lords<br>
Detachment retains the Chaos Space Marines Faction and is<br>
treated in all ways as a Chaos Space Marines Detachment, with<br>
the following modications:<br>
• They cannot include any Unique units.<br>
• Units that have a Mark of Chaos cannot be taken.<br>
• Units cannot be upgraded to take any Marks of Chaos.<br>
• All units that can do so must be upgraded to Veterans of the<br>
Long War, at no additional points cost.<br>
• Any Daemon of Tzeentch, Nurgle or Slaanesh that is a Psyker<br>
can choose to generate all of their psychic powers from the<br>
Discipline of Tzeentch, Nurgle or Slaanesh respectively.</p>

<p>All units in a Night Lords Detachment or Formation gain the<br>
following special rules:</p>

<h4>IN MIDNIGHT CLAD</h4>

<p>Units that have the Veterans of the Long War special rule have<br>
the Fear, Night Vision and Stealth special rules.</p>

<h4>SKYBORNEHORROR</h4>

<p>Units of Raptors are Troops choices instead of Fast<br>
Attack choices.</p>

<h4>TERROR TACTICS</h4>

<p>Enemy units that are locked in combat with any units from a<br>
Night Lords Detachment or Formation must subtract 2 from<br>
their Leadership when taking Fear tests.</p>
