<h3>ALPHA LEGION SPECIAL RULES</h3>

<p>Any Detachment with the Chaos Space Marines Faction can<br>
be from one of the nine Traitor Legions. An Alpha Legion<br>
Detachment retains the Chaos Space Marines Faction and is<br>
treated in all ways as a Chaos Space Marines Detachment, with<br>
the following modifications:<br>
• They cannot include any Unique units.<br>
• Units that have a Mark of Chaos cannot be taken.<br>
• Units cannot be upgraded to take any Marks of Chaos.<br>
• All units that can do so must be upgraded to Veterans of the<br>
Long War, at no additional points cost.<br>
• Any Daemon of Tzeentch, Nurgle or Slaanesh that is a Psyker<br>
can choose to generate all of their psychic powers from the<br>
Discipline of Tzeentch, Nurgle or Slaanesh respectively.</p>

<p>All units in an Alpha Legion Detachment or Formation gain<br>
the following special rules:</p>

<h4>FORWARD OPERATIVES</h4>

<p>Units of Chosen are Troops choices instead of Elites choices. In<br>
addition, all units of Chosen, Chaos Space Marines, and Chaos<br>
Cultists have the Infiltrate special rule.</p>

<h4>MANYHEADS OF THE HYDRA</h4>

<p>If your Warlord is from an Alpha Legion Detachment or<br>
Formation and they are slain, you can immediately select<br>
another character from a friendly Alpha Legion Detachment<br>
or Formation to take their place; generate a Warlord Trait for<br>
your new Warlord immediately. This can happen multiple<br>
times in the same battle, provided you follow these steps each<br>
time. Furthermore, if your Warlord is from an Alpha Legion<br>
Detachment or Formation and the mission you are playing<br>
grants Victory Points for slaying the enemy Warlord, your<br>
opponent will only achieve that objective if all of the characters<br>
in your Alpha Legion Detachment(s) and/or Formation(s) have<br>
been slain.</p>
