<h3>WORD BEARERS SPECIAL RULES</h3>

<p>Any Detachment with the Chaos Space Marines Faction can<br>
be from one of the nine Traitor Legions. A Word Bearers<br>
Detachment retains the Chaos Space Marines Faction and is<br>
treated in all ways as a Chaos Space Marines Detachment, with<br>
the following modifications:<br>
• They cannot include any Unique units.<br>
• Units that already have a Mark of Chaos (such as Plague<br>
Marines) cannot be taken, though units that have the option<br>
to take a Mark of Chaos as an upgrade can do so.<br>
• All units that can do so must be upgraded to Veterans of the<br>
Long War, at no additional points cost.<br>
• Psykers with the Mark of Tzeentch, Nurgle or Slaanesh<br>
can choose to generate all of their psychic powers from the<br>
Discipline of Tzeentch, Nurgle or Slaanesh respectively.<br>
• Any Daemon of Tzeentch, Nurgle or Slaanesh that is a Psyker<br>
can choose to generate all of their psychic powers from the<br>
Discipline of Tzeentch, Nurgle or Slaanesh respectively.</p>

<p>All units in a Word Bearers Detachment or Formation gain the<br>
following special rules:</p>

<h4>UNHOLY PACT</h4>

<p>Units of Possessed are Troops choices instead of Elites choices.<br>
In addition, Psykers from a Word Bearers Detachment<br>
or Formation harness Warp Charge points on a 3+ when<br>
attempting to manifest conjuration psychic powers from the<br>
Daemonology (Malefic) discipline.</p>

<h4>BLOOD FEUD</h4>

<p>All units with the Veterans of the Long War special rule<br>
re-roll failed To Hit rolls in every round of close combat when<br>
attacking Ultramarines units. However, all Ultramarines units<br>
have the Hatred (Word Bearers) rule.</p>

<h4>PROFANE ZEAL</h4>

<p>Friendly Word Bearers units within 6" of any Word Bearers<br>
Dark Apostles have the Zealot special rule.</p>
