<h3>BLACK LEGION SPECIAL RULES</h3>

<p>Any Detachment with the Chaos Space Marines Faction<br>
can be from one of the nine Traitor Legions. A Black Legion<br>
Detachment retains the Chaos Space Marines Faction and is<br>
treated in all ways as a Chaos Space Marines Detachment, with<br>
the following modifications:<br>
&nbsp;• They cannot include any Unique units other than Abaddon<br>
the Despoiler.<br>
&nbsp;• All units that can do so must be upgraded to Veterans of the<br>
Long War, at no additional points cost.<br>
&nbsp;• Psykers with the Mark of Tzeentch, Nurgle or Slaanesh<br>
can choose to generate all of their psychic powers from the<br>
Discipline of Tzeentch, Nurgle or Slaanesh respectively.<br>
&nbsp;• Any Daemon of Tzeentch, Nurgle or Slaanesh that is a Psyker<br>
can choose to generate all of their psychic powers from the<br>
Discipline of Tzeentch, Nurgle or Slaanesh respectively.</p>

<p>All units in a Black Legion Detachment or Formation gain the<br>
following special rules:</p>

<h4>ENDLESS HATRED</h4>

<p>Units that have the Veterans of the Long War special rule have<br>
the Hatred special rule, and can re-roll failed To Hit rolls in<br>
every round of close combat when attacking units that contain<br>
any models from the Armies of the Imperium.</p>

<h4>FIRST AMONGST TRAITORS</h4>

<p>Units of Chaos Terminators and Chosen are Troops choices<br>
instead of Elites choices.</p>
