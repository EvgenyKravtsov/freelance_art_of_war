<h3>DEATH GUARD SPECIAL RULES</h3>

<p>Any Detachment with the Chaos Space Marines Faction can<br>
be from one of the nine Traitor Legions. A Death Guard<br>
Detachment retains the Chaos Space Marines Faction and is<br>
treated in all ways as a Chaos Space Marines Detachment, with<br>
the following modi꒤cations:<br>
• They cannot include any Unique units other than Typhus.<br>
• Units that can take the Mark of Nurgle must do so.<br>
• Units with a Mark of Chaos other than the Mark of Nurgle<br>
cannot be taken.<br>
• All units that can do so must be upgraded to Veterans of the<br>
Long War, at no additional points cost.<br>
• Any Daemon Princes must have the Daemon of Nurgle<br>
special rule.<br>
• Psykers from the Detachment can choose to generate all of<br>
their psychic powers from the Discipline of Nurgle.</p>

<p>All units in a Death Guard Detachment or Formation gain the<br>
following special rules:</p>

<h4>GIFTS OF NURGLE</h4>

<p>Units that have the Veterans of the Long War special rule<br>
have the Fearless and Feel No Pain special rules, but reduce<br>
their Initiative characteristic by 1. Typhus and units of Plague<br>
Marines are unaffected.</p>

<h4>INEXORABLE ADVANCE</h4>

<p>Units that have the Veterans of the Long War special rule have the Relentless special rule.</p>

<h4>LORDS OF THE PLAGUE HOST</h4>

<p>Units of Plague Marines are Troops choices instead of Elites choices.</p>
