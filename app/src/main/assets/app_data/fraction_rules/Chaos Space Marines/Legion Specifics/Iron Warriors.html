<h3>IRON WARRIORS SPECIAL RULES</h3>

<p>Any Detachment with the Chaos Space Marines Faction can<br>
be from one of the nine Traitor Legions. An Iron Warriors<br>
Detachment retains the Chaos Space Marines Faction and is<br>
treated in all ways as a Chaos Space Marines Detachment, with<br>
the following modifications:<br>
• They cannot include any Unique units.<br>
• Units that have a Mark of Chaos cannot be taken.<br>
• Units cannot be upgraded to take any Marks of Chaos.<br>
• All units that can do so must be upgraded to Veterans of the<br>
Long War, at no additional points cost.<br>
• Any Daemon of Tzeentch, Nurgle or Slaanesh that is a Psyker<br>
can choose to generate all of their psychic powers from the<br>
Discipline of Tzeentch, Nurgle or Slaanesh respectively.</p>

<p>All units in an Iron Warriors Detachment or Formation gain<br>
the following special rules:</p>

<h4>BLOOD FEUD</h4>

<p>All units with the Veterans of the Long War special rule<br>
re-roll failed To Hit rolls in every round of close combat when<br>
attacking Imperial Fists units. However, all Imperial Fists units<br>
have the Hatred (Iron Warriors) special rule.</p>

<h4>IRON WITHIN, IRON WITHOUT</h4>

<p>Units with the Veterans of the Long War special rule have the<br>
Feel No Pain (6+) special rule.</p>

<h4>PATRONS OF THE TECHNOVIRUS</h4>

<p>Units of Obliterators and Mutilators are Troops choices instead<br>
of Elites choices.</p>

<h4>SIEGE MASTERS</h4>

<p>Units can re-roll armour penetration rolls against buildings<br>
that do not result in a glancing hit or penetrating hit, and add<br>
1 to the result when rolling on the Building Damage table. In<br>
addition, units of Havocs, Obliterators and Mutilators have the<br>
Tank Hunters special rule.</p>
