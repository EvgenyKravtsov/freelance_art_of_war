<h3>THOUSAND SONS SPECIAL RULES</h3>

<p>Any Detachment with the Chaos Space Marines Faction can<br>
be from one of the nine Traitor Legions. A Thousand Sons<br>
Detachment retains the Chaos Space Marines Faction and is<br>
treated in all ways as a Chaos Space Marines Detachment, with<br>
the following modifications:<br>
• They cannot include any Unique units other than Ahriman<br>
and Magnus the Red.<br>
• Units that can take the Mark of Tzeentch must do so.<br>
• Units with a Mark of Chaos other than the Mark of Tzeentch<br>
cannot be taken.<br>
• All units that can do so must be upgraded to Veterans of the<br>
Long War, at no additional points cost.<br>
• Any Daemon Princes must have the Daemon of Tzeentch<br>
special rule.<br>
• Any Psykers can choose to generate all of their psychic powers<br>
from the Discipline of Tzeentch.</p>

<p>All units in a Thousand Sons Detachment or Formation gain<br>
the following special rules:</p>

<h4>BLESSING OF TZEENTCH</h4>

<p>If a unit with the Veterans of the Long War special rule is<br>
affected by a blessing, their invulnerable save is improved by 1<br>
until the start of your next Psychic phase.</p>

<h4>BLOOD FEUD</h4>

<p>All units with the Veterans of the Long War special rule<br>
re-roll failed To Hit rolls in every round of close combat when<br>
attacking Space Wolves units. However, all Space Wolves units<br>
have the Hatred (Thousand Sons) special rule.</p>

<h4>LEGACY OF THE RUBRICAE</h4>

<p>Units of Rubric Marines are Troops choices instead of<br>
Elites choices</p>
