<p>A model or unit may only purchase one Mark of Chaos. An Independent Character with a Mark of Chaos may not join a unit with a different Mark of Chaos. When a Mark of Chaos is listed in a unit&#39;s special rules, its effects will have already been taken into account in its profile, where applicable.</p>

<h3><strong>MARK OF TZEENTCH</strong></h3>

<p>Models with the Mark of Tzeentch have +1 to their invulnerable save (to a maximum of 3+). If given to a model that does not already have an invulnerable safe, this mark confers an invulnerable save of 6+. Additionally, a Psyker with the Mark of Tzeentch must generate at least one of his powers from the Discipline of Tzeentch.</p>

<h3><strong>MARK OF NURGLE</strong></h3>
