<p><strong>If your Warlord has the Blood Angels Faction, these Tactical Objectives replace the Capture &amp; Control Tactical Objectives (numbers 11-16) described in Warhammer 40,000: The Rules. If a Warhammer 40,000 mission has the Tactical Objectives special rule, players use the normal rules for using Tactical Objectives with the following exception: when a Blood Angels player generates a Capture &amp; Control objective (numbers 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 or 16), the Blood Angels player instead generates the corresponding Blood Angels Tactical Objective, as shown in the table below. Other Tactical Objectives (numbers 21-66) are generated normally.</strong></p>
