<p>When generating Warlord traits for a Warlord with the Blood Angels Faction, you can either roll on one of the Warlord Traits tables in Warhammer 40,000: The Rules or roll on the table below. Note that if your Warlord is a Librarian Dreadnought, you must roll on the table below – he can never roll on any other Warlord Traits table.</p>

<h1><strong>D6 - WARLORD TRAIT</strong></h1>

<p><strong>1 Red Rampage: </strong>Your Warlord has the Rampage special rule.</p>

<p><strong>2 Speed of the Primarch: </strong>Your Warlord adds 1 to his Initiative.</p>

<p><strong>3 Artisan of War: </strong>Nominate one weapon carried by your Warlord. That weapon has the Master-crafted special rule. Note, however, that this cannot be applied to any Relics of Baal.</p>

<p><strong>4 Soulwarden: </strong>Your Warlord has the Adamantium Will special rule.</p>

<p><strong>5 Descent of Angels: </strong>Units in your Warlord’s Detachment with the Jump, Flyer or Skimmer unit type can re-roll failed Reserve Rolls. In addition, Jump and Skimmer units from your Warlord’s Detachment arriving from Deep Strike Reserve scatter D6" less than they usually would (normally D6" rather than 2D6").</p>

<p><strong>6 Heroic Bearing: </strong>Friendly units from the Armies of the Imperium (see the Allies chart in Warhammer 40,000: The Rules) within 12" of your Warlord have the Fearless special rule.</p>
