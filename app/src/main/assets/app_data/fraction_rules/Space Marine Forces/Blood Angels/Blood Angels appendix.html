<h1><strong>ARMY SPECIAL RULES:</strong></h1>

<p>A Blood Angels army uses the following special rule that is common to several of its units. Special rules that are unique to particular units are presented in the relevant entry instead. Other rules are simply listed by name &ndash; these are described in full in the Special Rules section of Warhammer 40,000: The Rules.</p>

<h1><strong>COMBAT SQUADS</strong></h1>

<p>A full strength, ten-man unit with this special rule can break down into two five-man units, called combat squads, considered to be two five-man squads of the same type. For example, ten-man Blood Angels Tactical Squad can split into two five-man Tactical Squads using the Combat Squads special rule.</p>

<p>You must decide which units are splitting into combat squads, and which models go into each combat squad, immediately before determining your Warlord Traits. A unit split into combat squads therefore is now two separate units for all game purposes, including calculating the total number of units in the army and determining the number of units you can place in Reserve. Then proceed with deployment as normal. In an exception to the normal rules, two combat squads split from the same unit can embark in the same transport vehicle, providing its Transport Capacity allows. Once you have decided whether or not to split a unit into combat squads, it must remain that way for the entire battle. It cannot split up or join back together later on in the battle, nor can you use a redeployment to split up a unit or join it back together.</p>

<p>Note that Bike Squads count as being at full strength when they have eight Space Marine Bikers and one Attack Bike. If split into combat squads, one combat squad will have five Bikers, the other will have three Bikers and the Attack Bike.</p>
