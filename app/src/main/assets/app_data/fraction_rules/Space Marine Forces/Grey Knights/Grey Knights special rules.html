<h2><strong>Brotherhood Commander:</strong></h2>

<p>If this Formation is chosen as your Primary Detachment, you can re-roll the result when rolling on the Warlord Traits table in</p>

<address>Codex: Grey Knights.</address>

<h2><strong>Psychic Brotherhood:</strong></h2>

<p>As long as this Formation&rsquo;s Grand Master is alive, all units in this Formation successfully harness Warp Charge on D6 results of 3+ when taking Psychic tests.</p>

<h2><strong>Rites of Teleportation:</strong></h2>

<p>Instead of making Reserve Rolls from the start of your turn two, you can make Reserve Rolls for any unit in this Formation that is placed in Deep Strike Reserve from the start of your turn one. These units will arrive from Deep Strike Reserve on turn one on the roll of 3+. In addition, all units from this Formation can both Run and Shoot, in any order, in the same turn that they arrive from Deep Strike Reserve.</p>
