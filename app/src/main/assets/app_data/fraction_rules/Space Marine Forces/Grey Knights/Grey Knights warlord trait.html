<p>When generating Warlord Traits, a Grey Knights Warlord may either roll on one of the Warlord Traits tables in Warhammer 40,000: The Rules or roll on the following table:</p>

<h2><strong>1 Daemon-Slayer:</strong></h2>

<p>The Warlord has the Hatred (Daemons) special rule. In addition, if the Warlord attempts to manifest the Banishment psychic power (see the Daemonology discipline), he will successfully harness Warp Charge points on D6 rolls of 2+.</p>

<h2><strong>2 Hammer of Righteousness:</strong></h2>

<p>The Warlord, and his unit, have the Hammer of Wrath special rule.</p>

<h2><strong>3 Unyielding Anvil:</strong></h2>

<p>The Warlord, and all friendly units with the Grey Knights Faction within 12&quot; of him, have the Stubborn special rule.</p>

<h2><strong>4 First to the Fray:</strong></h2>

<p>If placed in Deep Strike Reserve, the Warlord, and his unit, automatically arrive in your first turn and can re-roll the scatter dice when Deep Striking.</p>

<h2><strong>5 Perfect Timing:</strong></h2>

<p>The Warlord, and his unit, have the Counter-attack special rule.</p>

<h2><strong>6 Lore Master</strong></h2>

<p>The Warlord knows one more psychic power than is normal for his Psyker Mastery Level, which must be generated from the <strong>Daemonology (Sanctic)</strong></p>
