<p>If your Warlord has the Grey Knights Faction, these Tactical Objectives replace the Capture &amp; Control Tactical Objectives (numbers 11-16) described in <em>Warhammer 40,000: The Rules.</em></p>

<p>If a mission has the Tactical Objectives special rule, players use the normal rules for using Tactical Objectives (see Warhammer 40,000: The Rules) with the following exception: when a Grey Knights player generates a Capture &amp; Control objective (numbers 11-16), the Grey Knights player instead generates the corresponding Grey Knights Tactical Objective, as shown in the table (below). Other Tactical Objectives (numbers 21-66) are generated normally, as described in <em>Warhammer 40,000: The Rules.</em></p>

<h2><strong>D66 Result</strong></h2>

<h1><strong>11 DESTROY THE DAEMON</strong></h1>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<p>Score 1 Victory Point at the end of your turn if at least one enemy unit with the Daemon special rule has been destroyed by you. If between 2 and 5 enemy units with the Daemon special rule have been destroyed by you, score D3 Victory Points instead. If 6 or more enemy units with the Daemon special rule have been destroyed by you, score D3+3 Victory Points instead.</p>

<p></p>

<h1><strong>12 PSYCHIC COMMUNION</strong></h1>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<p>Score 1 Victory Point if your Grey Knights units successfully manifested at least 3 psychic powers during your turn. If your Grey Knights units successfully manifested 6 or more psychic powers during your turn, score D3 Victory Points instead.</p>

<p></p>

<h1><strong>13 NO WITNESSES!</strong></h1>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<p>Score 1 Victory Point at the end of your turn if every one of your opponent&rsquo;s models with the Independent Character special rule have been removed as casualties.</p>

<p></p>

<h1><strong>14 DEEDS OF LEGEND</strong></h1>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<p>Score 1 Victory Point if a Grey Knights character killed his opponent in a challenge during your turn. If, during your turn, a Grey Knights character killed an opponent in a challenge that was a Monstrous Creature or had the Independent Character special rule, score D3 Victory Points instead.</p>

<p></p>

<h1><strong>15 TELEPORT ATTACK</strong></h1>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<p>Score 1 Victory Point at the end of your turn if at least one enemy unit was completely destroyed by a Grey Knights unit that arrived from Deep Strike Reserve, made a teleport shunt, or was the target of the Gate of Infinity psychic power, during the same turn.</p>

<p></p>

<h1><strong>16 RITES OF EXORCISM</strong></h1>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<p>When this Tactical Objective is generated, your opponent must select an Objective Marker. If you control that Objective Marker at the end of your turn, score 1 Victory Point. If you control that Objective Marker at the end of the player turn in which this Tactical Objective was generated, score D3 Victory Points instead.</p>
