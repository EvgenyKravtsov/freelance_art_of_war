<h1><strong>COMBAT SQUADS</strong></h1>

<p>A full strength, ten-man unit with this special rule can break down into two five-man units, called combat squads, considered to be two five-man squads of the same type. For example, a ten-man Grey Knight Terminator Squad can split into two five-man Terminator Squads using the Combat Squads special rule. You must decide which units are splitting into combat squads, and which models go into each combat squad, immediately before determining your Warlord Traits. A unit split into combat squads therefore is now two separate units for all game purposes, including calculating the total number of units in the army and determining the number of units you can place in Reserve. Then proceed with deployment as normal. In an exception to the normal rules, two combat squads split from the same unit can embark in the same transport vehicle, providing its Transport Capacity allows. Once you have decided whether or not to split a unit into combat squads, it must remain that way for the entire battle. It cannot split up or join back together later on in the battle, nor can you use a redeployment to split up aunit or join it back together.</p>

<h1><strong>THE AEGIS</strong></h1>

<p>A unit that contains at least one model with this special rule re-rolls results of 1 when making Deny the Witch tests.</p>

<h1>PURITY OF SPIRIT</h1>

<p>Grey Knights Psykers can generate psychic powers from the Daemonology discipline (see Warhammer 40,000: The Rules). Grey Knights Psykers can only generate Sanctic powers from the Daemonology discipline &ndash; they cannot manifest Malefic psychic powers from this discipline. In addition, unless otherwise stated, when attempting to manifest psychic powers from the Daemonology discipline, Grey Knights Psykers only suffer Perils of the Warp if two or more 6s are rolled when taking a psychic test.</p>
