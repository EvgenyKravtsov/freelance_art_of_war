<h1><strong>SPACE WOLVES SPECIAL RULES</strong></h1>

<p>A Space Wolves army uses a number of special rules that are common to several of its units. Special rules that are unique to particular units are presented in their entries. Other, more common, rules are simply listed by name &ndash; these are described in full in the Special Rules section of Warhammer 40,000: The Rules.</p>

<h1><strong>FENRISIAN WOLVES AND CYBERWOLVES</strong></h1>

<p>Many Space Wolves characters have the option of taking Fenrisian Wolves and Cyberwolves as upgrades. If taken, they and the character are treated as a single unit.</p>

<p>If a Space Wolves character has the Independent Character special rule, he and his wolves (Fenrisian Wolves and/or Cyberwolves) are permitted to join other units, in which case both the character and his wolves join the unit. If the Independent Character then leaves the unit, all his surviving wolves also leave the unit, forming a separate unit with him.</p>

<p>If the Independent Character is killed whilst part of a unit, his surviving wolves are thereafter part of that unit and cannot leave it; the Independent Character&rsquo;s unit has been completely destroyed for the purposes of any victory conditions.</p>

<p>If the Independent Character is killed while he is not joined to another unit, do not remove any surviving wolves &ndash; in this case, the unit is not completely destroyed until all the wolves have been removed as casualties as well. These wolves cannot join other units. Another Independent Character can join the surviving wolves, but as they are not his upgrades, he cannot take them with him if he then joins another unit</p>
