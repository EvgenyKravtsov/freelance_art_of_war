<p>When generating his Warlord Traits, a Space Marine Warlord may either roll on one of the Warlord Traits tables in the Warhammer 40,000 rulebook or roll on the table below.</p>

<h1><strong>D6 - WARLORD TRAIT</strong></h1>

<p><strong>1. Saga of the Warrior Born: </strong>When fighting in a challenge, the Warlord re-rolls all failed To Hit rolls.</p>

<p><strong>2. Saga of the Wolfkin: </strong>The Warlord, and all friendly units with the Space Wolves Faction consisting entirely of models with either the Beasts or Cavalry unit type, have the Stubborn special rule. In addition, if a friendly unit with the Space Wolves Faction is within 12" of the Warlord at the start of the Assault phase, all models with either the Beasts or Cavalry unit type in that unit have the Furious Charge special rule until the end of the phase.</p>

<p><strong>3. Saga of the Beastslayer: </strong>The Warlord has the Monster Hunter special rule.</p>

<p><strong>4. Saga of the Bear: </strong>The Warlord, and his unit, have the Feel No Pain (6+) special rule.</p>

<p><strong>5. Saga of the Hunter: </strong>The Warlord has the Outflank and Stealth special rules.</p>

<p><strong>6. Saga of Majesty: </strong>The Warlord, and all friendly units with the Space Wolves Faction within 12" of him, must re-roll failed Morale checks and Pinning tests.</p>
