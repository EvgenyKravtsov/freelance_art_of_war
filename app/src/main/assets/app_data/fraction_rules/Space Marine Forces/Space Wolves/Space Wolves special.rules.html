<p><strong>Jarl of Russ: </strong>If this Formation is chosen as your Primary Detachment, you can re-roll the result when rolling on the Warlord Traits table in Codex: Space Wolves.</p>

<p><strong>Cunning of the Wolf: </strong>Before Deployment, roll a D6 for each unit in this Formation, adding +2 to the result if the unit&rsquo;s Battlefield Role is Troops and it has been joined by an Independent Character from this Formation (before rolling, inform your opponent which Independent Characters, if any, will start the game joined to which Troops units). On a 6+, that unit has the Outflank special rule. In addition, at the start of each of your turns after the first, you may select one unit from this Formation that is in Reserves. That unit automatically passes its Reserve Roll to arrive this turn (no dice roll is necessary).</p>

<p><strong>The Howl of Wolves: </strong>As long as this Formation&rsquo;s Wolf Lord is alive, all units in this Formation have the Fear and Furious Charge special rules.</p>
