<h3>If your Warlord has the Space Wolves Faction, these Tactical Objectives replace the Capture &amp; Control Tactical Objectives (numbers 11-16) described in Warhammer 40,000: The Rules. If a Warhammer 40,000 mission has the Tactical Objectives special rule, players use the normal rules for using Tactical Objectives with the following exception: when a Space Wolves player generates a Capture &amp; Control objective (numbers 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 or 16), he instead generates the corresponding Space Wolves Tactical Objective, as shown in the table opposite. Other Tactical Objectives (numbers 21-66) are generated normally, as described in Warhammer 40,000: The Rules.</h3>

<h1><strong>11 OATH OF VENGEANCE</strong></h1>

<p>When this Tactical Objective is generated, your opponent must nominate one of his characters from his Army Roster. Score 1 Victory Point at the end of your turn if the chosen character has been removed as a casualty during this, or any previous turn.</p>

<h1><strong>12 THE STUFF OF SAGAS</strong></h1>

<p>Score 1 Victory Point at the end of your turn if at least one enemy Vehicle or Monstrous Creature was destroyed during your turn. If any enemy Vehicle or Monstrous Creature was destroyed by a Space Wolves Character, score D3 Victory Points instead.</p>

<h1><strong>13 UNLEASH THE WOLVES</strong></h1>

<p>Score 1 Victory Point at the end of your turn if at least one enemy unit was completely destroyed during your Assault phase.</p>

<h1><strong>14 HOLD YOUR GROUND</strong></h1>

<p>When this Tactical Objective is generated your opponent must select a single objective marker that is within your table half. If you control that objective marker with the same unit at the end of two consecutive turns, score 2 Victory Points.</p>

<h1><strong>15 HUNT WITH CUNNING</strong></h1>

<p>Score 1 Victory Point at the end of your turn if at least one enemy unit was completely destroyed by a Space Wolves unit with the Scout, Infiltrate or Outflank special rules during your turn. If at least one enemy unit was completely destroyed by a Space Wolves unit with the Scout, Infiltrate or Outflank special rules during the same turn that it arrived from Reserves, score D3 Victory Points instead.</p>

<h1><strong>16 THE HEROES OF FENRIS</strong></h1>

<p>Score 1 Victory Point at the end of your turn if at least one of your Space Wolves characters issued or fought in a challenge during your turn. If between 3 and 5 of your Space Wolves characters issued or fought in a challenge during your turn, score D3 Victory points instead. If 6 or more of your Space Wolves characters issued or fought in a challenge during your turn, score D3+3 Victory Points instead.</p>
