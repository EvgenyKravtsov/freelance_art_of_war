<h1><strong>COMBAT SQUADS:</strong></h1>

<p>A full strength, ten-man unit with this special rule can break down into two five-man units, called combat squads, considered to be two five-man squads of the same type. For example, a ten-man Tactical Squad can split into two five-man Tactical Squads using the Combat Squads special rule.</p>

<p>You must decide which units are splitting into combat squads, and which models go into each combat squad, immediately before determining your Warlord Traits. A unit split into combat squads therefore is now two separate units for all game purposes, including calculating the total number of units in the army and determining the number of units you can place in reserve. Then proceed with deployment as normal. In an exception to the normal rules, two combat squads split from the same unit can embark in the same transport vehicle, providing its Transport Capacity allows. Once you have decided whether or not to split a unit into combat squads, it must remain that way for the entire battle. It cannot split up or join back together later on in the battle, nor can you use a redeployment to split up a unit or join it back together.</p>

<p>Note that Bike Squads count as being at full strength when they have eight Space Marine Bikers and one Attack Bike. If split into combat squads, one combat squad will have five Bikers, the other will have three and the Attack Bike.</p>

<p><strong>GRIM RESOLVE: </strong>Models with this special rule have the Stubborn special rule and, unless Jinking, count their Ballistic Skill as 2 when firing Overwatch.</p>

<p><strong>DEATHWING: </strong>A model with this special rule has the Fearless and Hatred (Chaos Space Marines) special rules.</p>



<p><strong>RAVENWING: </strong>A model with this special rule can re-roll failed cover saves when it Jinks.</p>








<p><strong>Marked for Retribution: </strong>Belial re-rolls all failed To Hit rolls when fighting in a challenge.</p>

<p><strong>Tactical Precision: </strong>Belial and his unit do not scatter when arriving by Deep Strike.</p>

<p><strong>Swift Vengeance: </strong>Sammael can fire up to two ranged weapons in the Shooting phase.</p>

<p><strong>Master of Repentance:</strong>If Asmodai slays the enemy Warlord in a challenge, you immediately score D3 extra Victory Points.</p>

<p><strong>Blessing of the Omnissiah:</strong>In each of your Shooting phases, instead of firing his weapons, a Techmarine can choose to repair a single friendly vehicle that he is in base contact with or embarked upon. To repair a vehicle, roll a D6 and add 1 for each Servitor with a servo-arm in his unit, and an additional 1 if the Techmarine has a servo-harness. If the result is a 5 or more, you may either restore a Hull Point lost earlier in the battle, or repair a Weapon Destroyed or Immobilised result suffered earlier in the battle; this is effective immediately.</p>

<p><strong>Bolster Defences:</strong>After deployment, but before Scout redeployments and Infiltrate deployments, nominate one piece of terrain in your deployment zone (this cannot be one you have purchased as part of your army). The terrain piece&rsquo;s cover save is increased by 1 for the duration of the game (to a maximum of 3+). Note that a piece of terrain can only be bolstered once.</p>

<p><strong>Mindlock:</strong>If it does not contain a Techmarine, an unengaged unit that contains at least one model with this special rule must roll a D6 at the start of its turn. On a 4+, this special rule has no effect this turn. On a 1, 2 or 3, the unit is mindlocked until the start of its following turn. A mindlocked unit may not voluntarily move, shoot or charge, but must still complete compulsory moves, such as Pile In and Fall Back moves.</p>

<p><strong>Venerable:</strong>If a Venerable Dreadnought suffers a penetrating hit, you can make your opponent re-roll the result on the Vehicle Damage table. You must accept the second result, even if it is worse than the first.</p>

<p><strong>Fortress of Shields:</strong>Any model in this unit that is equipped with a storm shield (including models with the Independent Character special rule that have joined it) and is in base contact with at least two other models from this unit has +1 Toughness.</p>

<p><strong>Repair:</strong>If a Rhino is Immobilised, then in subsequent turns, it may attempt to repair itself instead of shooting. To make the attempt, roll a D6 in the Shooting phase; on the roll of a 6+, the vehicle is no longer Immobilised. Note that a successful Repair does no restore a Hull Point.</p>

<p><strong>Drop Pod Assault: </strong>Drop Pods and units embarked upon them must be held in Deep Strike Reserve. At the beginning of your first turn, half of your Drop Pods (rounding up) automatically arrive from Reserve. The arrival of remaining Drop Pods is rolled for normally. Once a Drop Pod lands, all passengers must disembark and no models can embark for the rest of the game.</p>

<p><strong>Immobile:</strong>A Drop Pod cannot move once it has entered play, and counts in all respects as a vehicle that has suffered an Immobilised result that cannot be repaired in any way. This does not cause it to lose a Hull Point.</p>

<p><strong>Inertial Guidance System: </strong>If a Drop Pod scatters on top of impassable terrain or another model (friend or foe), reduce the scatter distance by the minimum required in order to avoid the obstacle. If the Drop Pod scatters off the edge of the board, it suffers a Deep Strike Mishap.</p>

<p><strong>Anti-grav Upwash: </strong>Whilst this unit includes at least three Ravenwing Land Speeders, it can move an additional 6&quot; when moving Flat Out.</p>

<p><strong>Icon of Old Caliban: </strong>Friendly units with the Dark Angels Faction within 6&quot; of one or more Ravenwing Darkshrouds gain the Fear and Stealth special rules (though this does not affect the Darkshrouds themselves). Furthermore, enemy units cannot fire Overwatch at friendly units with the Dark Angels Faction that are within 6&quot; of one or more Ravenwing Darkshrouds at the start of the Assault phase.</p>

<p><strong>Unrelenting Hunter:</strong>When shooting at enemy vehicles, a Nephilim Jetfighter can choose to treat any Weapon Destroyed result as an Immobilised result instead.</p>

<p><strong>Killshot: </strong>Whilst this unit includes three Predators, all Predators in the unit have the Monster Hunter and Tank Hunters special rules.</p>

<p><strong>Suppressive Bombardment: </strong>Whilst this unit includes three Whirlwinds, each model&rsquo;s Whirlwind multiple missile launcher has the Pinning and Shred special rules.</p>

<p><strong>Linebreaker Bombardment: </strong>Whilst this unit includes three Vindicators that can all fire their demolisher cannons, the unit can fire a single Linebreaker Bombardment instead of firing normally. To do so, nominate one model in the unit as the firer; the firer&rsquo;s demolisher cannon changes its type from Large Blast to Apocalyptic Blast and gains the Ignores Cover special rule.</p>

<p><strong>Master Tactician: </strong>An army that includes Azrael adds +1 to any Seize the Initiative rolls it makes.</p>

<p><strong>Rites of Battle: </strong>All friendly models with the Dark Angels Faction can use Azrael&rsquo;s Leadership value in place of their own.</p>

<p><strong>Supreme Strategist: </strong>When determining Warlord Traits for Azrael, choose any trait from the Dark Angels Warlord Traits table.</p>
