<p>When generating his Warlord Traits, a Space Marine Warlord may either roll on one of the Warlord Traits tables in the Warhammer 40,000 rulebook or roll on the table below.</p>

<h1><strong>D6 - WARLORD TRAIT</strong></h1>

<p><strong>1 The Hunt: </strong>Your Warlord has the Precision Shots special rule. In addition, your Warlord's shooting attacks have the Ignores Cover special rule.</p>

<p><strong>2 Courage of the First Legion: </strong>Your Warlord, and all friendly units with the Dark Angels Faction within 12" of gim, have the fearless special rule.</p>

<p><strong>3 For the Lion!: </strong>Your Warlord and his unit have the Furious Charge special rule.</p>





<p><strong>4 Brilliant Planning: </strong>While your Warlord is alive and on the battlefield, you can add1 to or substract 1 from any of your Reserve Rolls (choose after you roll the dice).</p>





<p><strong>5 Rapid Manoeuvre: </strong>Your Warlord and his unit add 3" to their maximum move distance when they move Flat Out, Turbo-boost, Run and make charge moves.</p>





<p><strong>6 Hold At All Costs: </strong>Your Warlord and his unit have the Feel No Pain special rule whilst they are within 3" of an Objective Marker.</p>
