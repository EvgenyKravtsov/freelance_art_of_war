<h2>Gifts of Phalanx</h2>

<h3>The Angel of Sacrifice……..10 POINTS</h3>

<p>Chaplain only. Replaces the model’s crozius arcanum.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Only in Death:</strong> If the bearer of the Angel of Sacrifice loses his last Wound in the Assault phase, he is not removed as a casualty until after all close combat attacks have been resolved, and can thus still attack if he is slain either by Overwatch or by a close combat attack made at a higher Initiative step.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The Banner of Staganda………25 POINTS</h3>

<p>May only be taken by a model that may take items from the Space Marine Standards list. The bearer has the Counter-attack and Crusader special rules. In addition,&nbsp;friendly units within 12” of the bearer, and with the same Chapter Tactics, re-roll failed Morale checks and Pinning tests.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The Bones of Osrak……..25 POINTS&nbsp;</h3>

<p>Librarian only. The bearer generates an additional Warp Charge point, and re-roll failed Psychic tests.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The Eye of Hypnoth…….15 POINTS&nbsp;</h3>

<p>A model with the Eye of Hypnoth can use it instead of making a shooting attack. If he does, target an enemy unit or building within 18” (this does not count as choosing a target for his unit to shoot at). A unit targeted by the Eye of Hypnoth has its cover save reduced by I until the end of the phase (this is not cumulative with the similar bonus granted by an Auspex - see Codex: Space Marines). A building targeted by the Eye of Hypnoth instead has all of its Armour Values reduced by 1 (to a minimum of 1) until the end of the phase.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The Spartean………..5 POINTS</h3>
