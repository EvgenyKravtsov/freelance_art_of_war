<p>When generating his Warlord Traits, a Space Marine Warlord may either roll on one of the Warlord Traits tables in the Warhammer 40,000 rulebook or roll on the table below.</p>

<h1><strong>D6 - WARLORD TRAIT</strong></h1>

<p><strong>1 - Angel of Death: </strong>Your Warlord has the Fear special rule. Furthermore, enemy units locked in combat with the Warlord must take Fear test on 3D6.</p>

<p><strong>2 - The Imperiumâ€™s Sword: </strong>One use only. Your Warlord, and his unit, have the Furious Charge special rule.</p>

<p><strong>3 - Iron Resolve: </strong>Your Warlord has the Feel No Pain special rule.</p>

<p><strong>4 - Storm of Fire: </strong>At the start of each your shooting phases, nominate one friendly unit within 12" of your Warlord that is drawn from the same Chapter as your Warlord. That unit's ranged weapons have the Rending special rule until the end of the phase. </p>

<p><strong>5 - Rites of War: </strong>All models in your Warlord's detachment can use his leadership value in place of their own.</p>

<p><strong>6 - Champion of Humanity: </strong>Your Warlord, and all friendly units within 12" of your Warlord with a Faction that is part of the Armies of the Imperium (see Warhammer 40.000: The Rules), must re-roll failed Morale chrcks, Pinning tests and Fear tests.</p>
