<p>Magnetokinesis is <strong>blessing</strong> that targets a single unit within 18". Unless the target is Zooming,&nbsp;Swooping or is&nbsp;locked in combat, it can immediately make a&nbsp;move of up to 18". The unit can move over all other models and terrain as if they were open ground, but it cannot end its move on top of other models or impassable terrain. Any models that starts or ends this move in difficult terrain must take a Dangerous Terrain test. The unit cannot charge in the same turn that it was moved using this&nbsp;power, and all models in the unit count as having moved in the Movement phase for the purposes of shooting weapons in the Shooting phase.</p>

<p>If either unit was&nbsp;locked in combat, the displaced unit is now locked in combat with that enemy - models cannot otherwise be placed within 1" of an enemy model. If either unit was Swooping, they are now Gliding.</p>

<p>Unless locked in close combat, these units can charge in the same turn.&nbsp;</p>
