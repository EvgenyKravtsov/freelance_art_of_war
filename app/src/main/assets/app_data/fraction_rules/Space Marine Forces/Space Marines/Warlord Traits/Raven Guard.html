<h2>Raven Guard Warlod Traits</h2>

<h3>1. Vanish into the Gloom</h3>

<p>When your Warlord's unit &nbsp;is chosen as the target of a shooting attack, it can immediately Vanish into the Gloom, moving up to D6". Models from your Warlord's unit that are in cover at the end of this move recieve +1 to their cover saving throws against that shooting attack. The firing unit cannot choose a different target, even if your Warlord's unit is now out of range or line of sight. Your Warlord's unit can only Vanish into the Gloom once per turn and cannot do so at all if Falling Back or charging.</p>

<h3>2. Concentrated Attack</h3>

<p>At the start of your Charge phase, pick an enemy unit within your Warlord's line of sight. Until the end of the phase, Raven Guard units can re-roll charge rolls against that unit.</p>

<h3>3. Master of Shadows</h3>

<p>Once per game, as long as your Warlord is on the battlefield, you can declare in your Movement phase that Night Fighting rules are in effect until the start of your next turn.</p>

<h3>4. Silent Stalker</h3>

<p>Enemy units wishing to fire Overwatch at your Warlord or his unit must first pass a Leadership test. If your Warlord charged through difficult terrain, subtract 2 from the enemy unit's Leadership when they take this test.</p>

<h3>5. Exit Strategy</h3>

<p>When rolling for Variabe Game Length, you can add or subtract 1 from the result if your Warlord is on battlefield.</p>

<h3>6. Swift and Deadly</h3>

<p>Once per battle, your Warlord, and any unit he has joined, can charge even if they Ran in the preceding Shooting phase.</p>
