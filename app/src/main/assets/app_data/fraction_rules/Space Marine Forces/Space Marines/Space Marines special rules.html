<h1><strong>COMBAT SQUADS:</strong></h1>

<p>A full strength, ten-man unit with this special rule can break down into two five-man units, called combat squads, considered to be two five-man squads of the same type. For example, a ten-man Tactical Squad can split into two five-man Tactical Squads using the Combat Squads special rule.</p>

<p>You must decide which units are splitting into combat squads, and which models go into each combat squad, immediately before determining your Warlord Traits. A unit split into combat squads therefore is now two separate units for all game purposes, including calculating the total number of units in the army and determining the number of units you can place in reserve. Then proceed with deployment as normal. In an exception to the normal rules, two combat squads split from the same unit can embark in the same transport vehicle, providing its Transport Capacity allows. Once you have decided whether or not to split a unit into combat squads, it must remain that way for the entire battle. It cannot split up or join back together later on in the battle, nor can you use a redeployment to split up a unit or join it back together.</p>

<p>Note that Bike Squads count as being at full strength when they have eight Space Marine Bikers and one Attack Bike. If split into combat squads, one combat squad will have five Bikers, the other will have three and the Attack Bike.</p>

<p><strong>Aid Unlooked For: </strong>The Legion of the Damned cannot be joined by Independent Characters. They always start the game in Deep Strike Reserve. When they arrive by Deep Strike, you can choose to re-roll both the 2D6 and the scatter dice.</p>

<p><strong>Blessing of the Omnissiah: </strong>In each of your Shooting phases, instead of firing his weapons, a Techmarine can choose to repair a single friendly vehicle that he is in base contact with or embarked upon. To repair a vehicle, roll a D6 and add 1 for each Servitor with a servo-arm in his unit, and an additional 1 if the Techmarine has a servo-harness. If the result is a 5 or more, you may either restore a Hull Point lost earlier in the battle, or repair a Weapon Destroyed or Immobilised result suffered earlier in the battle; this is effective immediately.</p>

<p><strong>Bolster Defences: </strong>After deployment, but before Scout redeployments and Infiltrate deployments, nominate one piece of terrain in your deployment zone (this cannot be one you have purchased as part of your army). The terrain piece&rsquo;s cover save is increased by 1 for the duration of the game (to a maximum of 3+). Note that a piece of terrain can only be bolstered once.</p>


<p><strong>Decimator Protocols: </strong>A model with this special rule can fire up to two weapons in its Shooting phase.</p>

<p><strong>Drop Pod Assault: </strong>Drop Pods and units embarked upon them must be held in Deep Strike Reserve. At the beginning of your first turn, half of your Drop Pods (rounding up) automatically arrive from Reserve. The arrival of remaining Drop Pods is rolled for normally. Once a Drop Pod lands, all passengers must disembark and no models can embark for the rest of the game.</p>

<p><strong>Escort Craft: </strong>When making Reserve Rolls, make a single roll for this entire Formation.
On a successful Reserves Roll, all of the units in this Formation arrive from Reserve.</p>


<p><strong>Flaming Projectiles: </strong>Ranged attacks made by the Legion of the Damned have the Ignores Cover special rule.</p>

<p><strong>Heroic Intervention: </strong>A unit with this special rule can re-roll one or both dice when determining its charge range. Furthermore, a unit with this special rule ignores the penalty for disordered charges.</p>

<p><strong>Honour or Death: </strong>A model with this special rule must issue and accept a challenge whenever possible. If there is more than one friendly model in a combat with this rule, you may select which model issues or accepts the challenge.</p>

<p><strong>Immobile: </strong>A Drop Pod cannot move once it has entered play, and counts in all respects as a vehicle that has suffered an Immobilised result that cannot be repaired in any way. This does not cause it to lose a Hull Point.</p>

<p><strong>Inertial Guidance System: </strong>If a Drop Pod scatters on top of impassable terrain or another model (friend or foe), reduce the scatter distance by the minimum required in order to avoid the obstacle. If the Drop Pod scatters off the edge of the board, it suffers a Deep Strike Mishap.</p>

<p><strong>Mindlock: </strong>If it does not contain a Techmarine, an unengaged unit that contains at least one model with this special rule must roll a D6 at the start of its turn. On a 4+, this special rule has no effect this turn. On a 1, 2 or 3, the unit is mindlocked until the start of its following turn. A mindlocked unit may not voluntarily move, shoot or charge, but must still complete compulsory moves, such as Pile In and Fall Back moves.</p>

<p>Orbital Bombardment: <strong>Once per game, use an orbital bombardment in your Shooting phase. This counts as a ranged weapon with the profile below. This does not prevent charging the target unit that turn.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Orbital: </strong>If an arrow is rolled on the scatter dice, always scatter the full 2D6&quot;, regardless of Ballistic Skill.</p>

<p><strong>Repair: </strong>If a Rhino is Immobilised, then in subsequent turns, it may attempt to repair itself instead of shooting. To make the attempt, roll a D6 in the Shooting phase; on the roll of a 6+, the vehicle is no longer Immobilised. Note that a successful Repair does not restore a Hull Point.</p>

<p><strong>Skies of Fury: </strong>If the Stormraven has moved more than 6&quot;, passengers can still disembark, but they must do so as follows: Nominate any point over which the Stormraven moved that turn and deploy the squad as if it were Deep Striking onto that point. If the unit scatters, every disembarking model must immediately take a Dangerous Terrain test. If any of the models cannot be deployed, the entire unit is destroyed. Models that disembark using the Skies of Fury special rule cannot charge on the turn they do so.</p>

<p><strong>Unyielding Spectres: </strong>3+ invulnerable save.</p>

<p><strong>Venerable: </strong>If a Venerable Dreadnought suffers a penetrating hit, you can make your opponent re-roll the result on the Vehicle Damage table. You must accept the second result, even if it is worse than the first.</p>

<p><strong>Skystorm: </strong>Whilst this unit includes three Stalkers, each model&rsquo;s Icarus stormcannon array has the Ignores Cover special rule.</p>

<p><strong>Savant Interlocution: </strong>Whilst this unit includes three Hunters, each model&rsquo;s skyspear missile launcher can re-roll the dice when resolving its Savant Lock special rule.</p>

<p><strong>Linebreaker Bombardment: </strong>If this unit contains three Vindicators that can all fire their demolisher cannons, the squadron can fire a single Linebreaker Bombardment instead of firing normally. To do so, nominate one model in the squadron as the firer; the firer&rsquo;s demolisher cannon changes its type from Large Blast to Apocalyptic Blast and gains the Ignores Cover special rule.</p>

<p><strong>Suppressive Bombardment: </strong>Whilst this unit includes three Whirlwinds, each model&rsquo;s Whirlwind multiple missile launcher has the Pinning and Shred special rules (regardless of which missile type it fires).</p>

<p><strong>Killshot: </strong>Whilst this unit includes three Predators, all Predators in the unit have the Monster Hunter and Tank Hunters special rules.</p>

<p><strong>Convergent Targeting: </strong>Whilst this unit includes three Thunderfire Cannons, all Techmarine Gunners in the unit have +1 Ballistic Skill.</p>

<p><strong>Vectored Afterburners: </strong>When Zooming, a Stormtalon Gunship can move an additional 6&quot; if it moves Flat Out. When Hovering, a Stormtalon Gunship receives +1 to its Jink cover saves (other cover saves are unaffected).</p>

<p><strong>Anti-grav Upwash: </strong>Whilst this unit includes three Land Speeders, it can move an additional 6&quot; when moving Flat Out.</p>

<p><strong>Jamming Beacon: </strong>Enemies that scatter when Deep Striking within 12&quot; of a model with this special rule roll double the number of dice to determine the scatter distance.</p>

<p><strong>Mounted Assault: </strong>If a unit with this special rule is chosen as part of a Detachment that contains at least one independent character with the Space Marines Faction equipped with a Space Marine bike, the unit&rsquo;s Battlefield Role changes to Troops.</p>

<h2><strong>Character Special Rules: </strong></h2>

<p><strong>Relics of Helsreach: </strong>Friendly Black Templars units within 6" of one or more Cenobyte
Servitors have the Feel No Pain special rule.</p>

<p><strong>Slayer of Champions: </strong>When fighting in a challenge, the Emperor’s Champion re-rolls
failed To Hit rolls, and any To Wound rolls of 6 are resolved with the Instant Death
special rule.</p>

<p><strong>Legacy of Dorn: </strong>The Sword of the High Marshals gives High Marshal
Helbrecht a Charge Bonus of D3 Attacks instead of one.</p>

<p><strong>Crusade of Wrath: </strong>Once per game, at the beginning of your Assault phase, High
Marshal Helbrecht can grant all friendly Black Templars models the Hatred and Fleet
special rules until the end of that phase.</p>

<p><strong>Hold the Line: </strong>Sternguard Veterans that are part of Pedro Kantor’s Detachment have
the Objective Secured special rule. A unit with this special rule controls objectives even if
an enemy scoring unit is within range of the Objective Marker, unless the enemy unit
also has this special rule.</p>

<p><strong>Oath of Rynn: </strong>All models in Kantor’s Detachment have the Preferred Enemy (Orks)
special rule. These models also add 1 to their Attacks if within 12" of Pedro Kantor.</p>

<p><strong>Icon of Obstinacy: </strong>If Lysander is your Warlord, all friendly Imperial Fists units within
12" of him re-roll failed Morale checks, Pinning tests and Fear tests.</p>

<p><strong>See, But Remain Unseen: </strong>Shrike has the Stealth and Infiltrate special rules. Before
deploying, he may only join units of Jump Infantry.</p>

<p><strong>The Forgefather:</strong>If Vulkan He’stan is your Warlord, all meltaguns, combi-meltas and
multi-meltas fired by models in his Detachment have the Master-crafted special rule.</p>



<p><strong>Master of the Hunt:</strong>If Kor’sarro Khan is your Warlord, friendly White Scars models
that have the Bike unit type, or are embarked on a Rhino or Razorback, have the Scouts
special rule.</p>

<p><strong>Ultramarines Tank Commander:</strong>When adding Sergeant Chronus to your army, you
must also take a single Rhino, Razorback, Predator, Whirlwind, Vindicator, Hunter,
Stalker, Land Raider, Land Raider Crusader or Land Raider Redeemer, paying the points
cost listed on that vehicle’s datasheet as well as the 50 points for Sergeant Chronus. The
chosen vehicle is a character and has Ballistic Skill 5. In addition, it has the It Will Not
Die special rule and ignores the effects of Crew Shaken and Crew Stunned results.
If the tank is Wrecked or suffers an Explodes! result, Sergeant Chronus is treated as a
passenger. (Note that if the vehicle does not have an Access Point, he will have to perform
an emergency disembarkation). Assuming Sergeant Chronus survives his vehicle’s
destruction, he uses his own characteristic profile and special rules as normal from that
point on.</p>

<p><strong>Voice of Experience:</strong>If Sergeant Telion does not make a shooting attack or Run in the
Shooting phase, you can nominate one model in his squad. That model can use Sergeant
Telion’s Ballistic Skill that phase.</p>

<p><strong>Eye of Vengeance: </strong>Shots fired by Sergeant Telion (excluding Snap Shots) are always рrecision Shots (see the Precision Shots special rule in Warhammer 40,000: The Rules).</p>

<p><strong>Master of Prescience:</strong>When generating psychic powers, Tigurius may re-roll any roll of
the dice to see which powers he knows. In addition, if your army contains Tigurius, you
can choose to re-roll any Reserve Rolls that apply to units from the same Detachment.</p>

<p><strong>Battle-forged Heroes:</strong>During deployment, choose one friendly Ultramarines Tactical
Squad. It gains one of the following special rules for the duration of the battle: Counterattack,
Infiltrate, Scout or Tank Hunters.</p>
