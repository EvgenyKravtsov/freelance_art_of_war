<h2>Imperial Fists Warlord Traits</h2>

<h3>1. Siege Lord</h3>

<p>Your Warlord and his unit add 1 to the result when rolling on the Building Damage table.</p>

<h3>2. Tenacious Opponent</h3>

<p>Your Warlord has the It Will Not Die special rule.</p>

<h3>3. Wise Commander</h3>

<p>Whilst your Warlord is alive, you can choose to add or subtract 1 from any of your Reserve Rolls (state which before the dice is rolled).</p>

<h3>4. Indomitable</h3>

<p>If your Warlord and his unit do not move in their Movement phase, then he and his unit have the Fearless and Counter-attack special rule until the start of their next turn.</p>

<h3>5. Architect of&nbsp;War</h3>

<p>Whilst your Warlord is embarked inside a building, all damage rolls against that building suffer a -1 penalty, to a minimum of 1.</p>

<h3>6. Fleet Commander</h3>

<p>Once per game, your Warlord can call down an orbital strike in his Shooting phase. This counts as firing a ranged weapon with the profile below. This does not prevent the Warlord and his unit from declaring a charge against the target unit that turn.</p>

		<tr>
			<td style="text-align: center;">Range</td>
			<td style="text-align: center;">S</td>
			<td style="text-align: center;">AP</td>
			<td style="text-align: center;">Type</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td style="text-align: center;">Infinite</td>
			<td style="text-align: center;">10</td>
			<td style="text-align: center;">1</td>
			<td style="text-align: center;">Ordnance 1, Barrage, Large Blast, Orbital</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>

<p><strong>Orbital:</strong>&nbsp;If an arrow is rolled on the scatter dice, the blast marker scatters the full 2D6" - the Warlord's Ballistic Skill makes no difference.</p>
