<h2>PRIMARIS POWER</h2>

<h3>SUBVERT MACHINE....................WARP CHARGE 1</h3>

<p>Subvert Machine is a <strong>malediction</strong> that targets a single enemy vehicle within 18". If this power is successfully manifested, randomly select one of the vehicle’s weapons (do not include Bombs, weapons with the One Use Only/One Shot Only special rule that have already fired, and weapons that have been destroyed). Then, you and your opponent each roll a dice and look up the result below:<br>
<br>
If your opponent rolls higher, nothing happens.<br>
<br>
If the results are drawn, then that weapon can only fire Snap Shots whilst this power is in effect.<br>
<br>
If you roll higher, you can immediately shoot with that weapon at another enemy unit – the weapon&nbsp;fires using the vehicle’s Ballistic Skill, unless the vehicle is Crew Stunned or Shaken, in which case the weapon can only fire Snap Shots.</p>

1.BLESSING OF MACHINE.....................WARP CHARGE 1</h3>

<p>Blessing of Machine&nbsp;is a <strong>blessing</strong> that targets a single friendly vehicle within 24". Whilst the power is in effect, the target<br>
vehicle ignores the effects of Crew Shaken and/or Crew Stunned damage results and has the Power of the Machine<br>
Spirit special rule. If the vehicle already has this special rule, it instead increases its Ballistic Skill by 1 whilst this power<br>
is in effect.</p>

In addition, the target vehicle has the It Will Not Die special rule whilst this power is in effect.</p>

<p>If the Psyker is embarked on a Transport vehicle, he may still attempt to manifest this psychic power, but may only target the vehicle he is embarked upon.</p>

<h3>4. WARPMETAL ARMOUR......WARP CHARGE 2</h3>
