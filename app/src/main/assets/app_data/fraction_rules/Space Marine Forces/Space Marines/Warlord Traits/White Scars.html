<h2>White Scars Warlord Traits</h2>

<h3>1. Master Rider</h3>

<p>Add 1 to the result of any Jink saves you make for your Warlord if he is equipped with a Space Marine bike. If he is not, treat this result as 'Deadly Ambush' instead.</p>

<h3>2. Deadly Ambush</h3>

<p>You can add or subtract 1 from the result of any Reserve Rolls you make while your Warlord is on battlefield or in Reserve.</p>

<h3>3. Hunter's Instincts</h3>

<p>Your Warlord has the Monster Hunter and Tank Hunters special rules.</p>

<h3>4. Hammer of the Khan</h3>

<p>Your Warlord has the Hammer of Wrath special rule. If he already has this special rule, he makes D3 additional attacks instead of 1.</p>

<h3>5. Unrivalled Hunter</h3>

<p>Add 1 to your Warlord's Strength and Attacks characteristics while he is fighting in a challenge. If he is fighting in a challenge against an enemy Warlord, he can also re-roll failed To Hit rolls.</p>

<h3>6. Merciless Warrior</h3>

<p>When your Warlord or a friendly White Scars unit within 12" makes a Sweeping Advance, you can re-roll the dice.</p>
