<h1><strong>LEGION OF THE DAMNED WARLORD TRAITS</strong></h1>

<p>If you are fielding an army where the primary detachment is a Legion of the Damned detachment, one Legionnaire Sergeant must be nominated as your army&rsquo;s Warlord. When generating his Warlord Traits, a Legion of the Damned Warlord may either roll on one of the Warlord Traits tables in the Warhammer 40,000 rulebook or roll on the table below.</p>

<h2><strong>D6 - RESULT</strong></h2>

<h3><strong>1 - Inferno of Vengeance: </strong></h3>

<p>The Warlord, and his unit, have the Soul Blaze special rule.</p>

<h3><strong>2 - Aura of Fear</strong></h3>

<p>When taking Fear tests, enemy units in base contact with the Warlord&rsquo;s unit suffer a cumulative -1 penalty to their Leadership value for each friendly Legion of the Damned squad on the battlefield beyond the first.</p>

<h3><strong>3 - Ethereal Bolts: </strong></h3>

<p>The Warlord, and his unit, have the Armourbane special rule when firing any of the following weapons: bolt pistol, boltgun, storm bolter, heavy bolter, or any combi-weapon firing as a boltgun.</p>

<h3><strong>4 - Spectral Bulwark: </strong></h3>

<p>The Warlord, and his unit, have the Feel No Pain (5+) special rule.</p>

<h3><strong>5 - Never Too Late, Never Too Early: </strong></h3>

<p>Instead of making a Reserve Roll for the Warlord and his unit at the start of Turn Two, the controlling player can choose whether or not he wishes them to arrive that turn. If he decides to keep them in Reserve, he can also choose whether or not he wishes them to arrive at the start of Turn Three. However, if they have not done so already, the Warlord and his unit automatically arrives at the start of Turn Four.</p>

<h3><strong>6 - Retribution Made Manifest:</strong></h3>
