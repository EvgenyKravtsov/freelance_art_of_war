<h1><strong>LEGION OF THE DAMNED SPECIAL RULES:</strong></h1>

<h2><strong>Aid Unlooked For: </strong></h2>

<p>All units from the Legion of the Damned detachment arrive from Reserve at the start of the Legion of the Damned player&rsquo;s Turn 1. These units must enter play via Deep Strike as normal.</p>

<h2><strong>Fear</strong></h2>

<p>At the start of each Fight sub-phase, a unit in base contact with one or more enemy models that cause Fear must take a Leadership test (called a Fear test) before any blows are struck. If the test is passed, all is well and there is no effect. If the test is failed, the unit succumbs to fear &ndash; all models in the unit have their Weapon Skill reduced to 1 for the remainder of that Fight sub-phase.</p>

<p>Note that some units are less prone to Fear than others. Units that contain one or more models with the And They Shall Know No Fear or Fearless special rules automatically pass Fear tests. However, a model that causes Fear is not itself immune to Fear.</p>

<h2><strong>Fearless</strong></h2>

<p>Units containing one or more models with the Fearless special rule automatically pass Pinning, Fear and Regroup tests and Morale checks, but cannot Go to Ground and cannot choose to fail a Morale check due to the Our Weapons are Useless rule.</p>

<h2><strong>Flaming Projectiles</strong></h2>

<p>Ranged attacks made by the Legion of the Damned have the Ignores Cover special rule.</p>

<h2><strong>Slow and Purposeful</strong></h2>

<p>A unit that contains at least one model with this special rule cannot Run, Turboboost, move Flat Out, perform Sweeping Advances or fire Overwatch. They can, however, shoot with Heavy, Salvo and Ordnance weapons, counting as stationary even if they moved in the previous Movement phase. They are also allowed to charge in the same turn they fire Heavy, Ordnance, Rapid Fire or Salvo weapons.</p>

<h2><strong>Unyielding Spectres</strong></h2>

<p>The Legion of the Damned have a 3+ invulnerable save.</p>
