<h1><strong>Perils of the Warp</strong></h1>
<p>The Warp is the source of all psychic powers, but there are many dangers for
those who utilise this wellspring of otherworldly energy. When a Psyker
suffers Perils of the Warp, it indicates that something horrible has happened to
the Psyker, the forces of the Daemon-haunted Warp clawing at the Psyker’s
mind, threatening to engulf and destroy him.</p>

<p>If a unit suffers Perils of the Warp, roll a D6 and consult the Perils of the Warp
table below. If the unit has the Brotherhood of Psykers/Sorcerers special rule,
the effects of the Perils of the Warp result apply a randomly determined model
in the unit who has the Brotherhood of Psykers/Sorcerers special rule.</p>

<p>Note that suffering Perils of the Warp does not necessarily mean that a psychic
power fails to manifest. Assuming that the Psychic test was successful and any
Deny the Witch test failed, the psychic power still manifests, regardless of
whether or not the Psyker in question suffers a Wound or is slain by Perils of
the Warp.</p>

<h2><strong>D6 - Result</strong></h2>



<h3><strong>1 - Dragged into the Warp:</strong></h3>

<p>The Psyker must take a Leadership test. If the test
is passed, the Psyker suffers 1 Wound/glancing hit with no saves of any kind
allowed. If the test is failed, the Psyker is removed as a casualty and his unit
suffers D6 Strength 6 AP1 hits. For Wound allocation purposes, assume the
attack is coming from the Psyker that suffered Perils of the Warp.</p>

<h3><strong>2 - Mental Purge:</strong></h3>

<p>The Psyker suffers 1 Wound/glancing hit with no saves of
any kind allowed. In addition, randomly select one psychic power known to the
Psyker. That power is immediately lost, and cannot be used by the Psyker for
the rest of the battle.</p>

<h3><strong>3 - Power Drain:</strong></h3>

<p>The Psyker suffers 1 Wound/glancing hit with no saves of
any kind allowed. In addition, if it is currently the Psychic phase, roll a D3;
both players lose a number of Warp Charge points equal to the result.</p>


<h3><strong>4 - Psychic Backlash:</strong></h3>

<p>The Psyker suffers 1 Wound/glancing hit with no saves
of any kind allowed.</p>


<h3><strong>5 - Empyric Feedback:</strong></h3>

<p>The Psyker must take a Leadership test. If the test is
failed, the Psyker suffers 1 Wound/glancing hit with no saves of any kind
allowed. If the test is passed, the Psyker suffers no ill effects… this time.</p>

<h3><strong>6 - Warp Surge:</strong></h3>

<p>The Psyker must take a Leadership test. If the test is failed,
the Psyker suffers 1 Wound/glancing hit with no saves of any kind allowed. If
the test is passed, the Psyker gains a 3+ Invulnerable save as well as the
Fleshbane, Armourbane and Smash special rules, until the start of the next
friendly Psychic phase.</p>
