<h1><strong>Vehicle Damage Table</strong></h1>

<h2><strong>D6 - Result</strong></h2>

<h1><strong>1-3 - Crew Shaken</strong></h1>

<p>The vehicle can only fire Snap Shots until the end of its
next turn.</p>

<h1><strong>4 - Crew Stunned</strong></h1>

<p>The
vehicle can only fire Snap Shots until the end of its next turn. If the vehicle is a
Zooming Flyer, it must move 18" and cannot turn at all in its next Movement
phase. If the vehicle is not a Zooming Flyer, it cannot move or pivot until the
end of its next turn.</p>

<h1><strong>5 - Weapon Destroyed</strong></h1>

<p>One of the vehicle’s weapons (randomly chosen) is
destroyed – including any combi- or built in weapons. This can include vehicle
upgrades that are weapons, such as pintle-mounted storm bolters or hunterkiller
missiles. Do not count weapons that have run out of ammunition –
they’re already non-functional for the most part. If a vehicle has no weapons
left, treat this result as an Immobilised result instead (see below).</p>


<h1><strong>6 - Immobilised</strong></h1>

<p>If the vehicle is a Chariot, count this result as a Crew
Stunned result instead (see above). If the vehicle is a Zooming Flyer, roll a
further D6: on a 1 or 2, that Flyer will immediately Crash and Burn! (see
below), on a 3+ the Flyer counts this result as Crew Stunned instead (see
above). Other vehicles are Immobilised. An Immobilised vehicle cannot move
– it may not even pivot, but its turrets may continue to rotate to select targets,
and other weapons retain their normal arcs of fire. Any Immobilised results
suffered by an already Immobilised vehicle instead remove an additional Hull
Point.</p>




<h1><strong>7+ - Explodes!</strong></h1>

<p>The vehicle is destroyed. If the vehicle is a Zooming
Flyer, it will immediately Crash and Burn! (see below), otherwise nearby units
suffer a Strength 4 AP- hit for each model within D6" of the vehicle (resolve
this once, regardless of how many times the result is inflicted), as flaming
debris scatters across the area. The vehicle is then removed from the
battlefield.</p>



<h1><strong>Crash and Burn!</strong></h1>

<p>Centre the large blast marker over the Flyer – it then
scatters 2D6". Any units under the blast marker’s final position suffer a
number of Strength 6 AP- hits equal to the number of models that unit has under the marker. The Flyer is then removed from the battlefield.</p>
