<h1><strong>Building Damage Table</strong></h1>

<h2><strong>D6</strong></h2>


<h1><strong>0-1 - Breach!</strong></h1>

<p><strong>The building’s Armour Value is reduced by 1 (on all facings) for the remainder
of the battle. This is cumulative with any other penalties to the building’s
Armour Value.</strong>The model is unharmed.</p>

<h1><strong>2 - Tremor.</strong></h1>

<p><strong>If the building is occupied, the occupying unit can only make Snap Shots in the
following turn. If an occupying unit abandons the building in their next turn,
they can only disembark 3", rather than the full 6".</p>

<h1><strong>3 - Partial Collapse.</strong></h1>

<p><strong>If the building is occupied, the occupying unit suffers D6 Strength 6 AP- hits
with the Ignores Cover special rule. In addition, if the building has any
emplaced weapons, they can only fire Snap Shots in the following turn.</p>

<h1><strong>4 - Structural Collapse.</strong></h1>

<p><strong>If the building is occupied, the occupying unit suffers 2D6 Strength 6 AP- hits
with the Ignores Cover special rule. In addition, if the building has any
emplaced weapons, one randomly determined weapon is destroyed and the remainder can only fire Snap Shots in the following turn.</p>

<h1><strong>5 - Catastrophic Breach.</strong></h1>

<p><strong>The building’s Armour Value is reduced by D3 (on all facings) for the
remainder of the battle. This is cumulative with any other penalties to the
building’s Armour Value. In addition, if the building has any emplaced
weapons, one randomly determined weapon is destroyed and the remainder
can only fire Snap Shots in the following turn.</p>

<h1><strong>6 - Total Collapse.</strong></h1>

<p><strong>The building is destroyed: all emplaced weapons and battlement upgrades on
the building are also destroyed. If the building is occupied, the occupying unit
suffers 2D6 Strength 6 AP- hits with the Ignores Cover special rule and must
then immediately disembark from the building, performing an emergency
disembarkation if necessary (survivors cannot disembark to the battlements).
Any models that cannot disembark are removed as casualties. Assuming they
were not destroyed, units that have disembarked must then take a Pinning test.
The building is left on the table, but can no longer be occupied.
Battlements that are part of a building that suffers a Total Collapse damage
result are destroyed. Each unit on the battlements suffers D6 Strength 6 APhits
with the Ignores Cover special rule, and must then take a Pinning test. The
battlements are considered to be Ruins terrain for the rest of the battle.</p>

<h1><strong>7+ - Detonation!</strong></h1>

<p><strong>The building is destroyed: all emplaced weapons and battlement upgrades on
the building are also destroyed. If the building is occupied, the occupying unit
suffers 4D6 Strength 6 AP- hits with the Ignores Cover special rule and must
then immediately disembark from the building, performing an emergency
disembarkation if necessary (survivors cannot disembark to the battlements).
Any models that cannot disembark are removed as casualties. Assuming they
were not destroyed, units that have disembarked must then take a Pinning test.
The building is then removed and replaced with a crater of roughly the same
size (if you have one).
Battlements that are part of a building that suffers a Detonation damage result
are destroyed. Each unit on the battlements suffers 2D6 Strength 6 AP- hits
with the Ignores Cover special rule and must then immediately make a 6"
move in order to move off of the battlements (this movement is not slowed by
difficult terrain). Any models that cannot move off of the battlements are
removed as casualties. Assuming they were not destroyed, all units that had to
move off the battlements must then take a Pinning test.</p>
