<p><strong>Soulfright:</strong>At the end of the Shooting phase, a unit that has suffered one or more hits from a weapon with this special rule in that phase must make a Leadership test. The unit suffers a single additional Wound, with no armour or cover saves allowed, for each point this test is failed by. Wounds cannot be allocated to models with the Fearless or And They Shall Know No Fear special rules (any excess Wounds are lost).</p>

<h2><strong>Shock Prow</strong></h2>
<p>A vehicle with a shock prow can Tank Shock and Ram even if it is not a Tank. In addition, when the vehicle executes a Ram, it is treated as having a front Armour Value of 14 when working out the effect of the Ram upon both the vehicle and its target.</p>



<h2><strong>Splinter Racks</strong></h2>
<p>Whilst a model is embarked on a vehicle with splinter racks, all splinter weapons have the Twin-linked special rule.</p>
