<p><strong>Rules for the following items can be found in the Warhammer 40,000 rulebook.</strong></p>

<p>Frag grenades*, Krak grenades, Melta bombs</p>

<p>*See assault grenades</p>

<h2><strong>Blessed Standard: </strong></h2>

<p>Friendly units within 12&quot; of the bearer re-roll failed Morale, Fear and Pinning tests.</p>

<h2><strong>Chirurgeon&rsquo;s Tools: </strong></h2>

<p>As long as the Hospitaller is alive, all models in her unit have the Feel No Pain special rule.</p>

<h2><strong>Jump Pack: </strong></h2>

<p>A model equipped with a jump pack gains the Jump unit type as described in the Warhammer 40,000 rulebook.</p>

<h2><strong>Laud Hailer: </strong></h2>

<p>All friendly units within 12&quot; of a model with a laud hailer re-roll failed Leadership tests when attempting an Act of Faith.</p>

<h2><strong>Rosarius: </strong></h2>

<p>A rosarius confers a 4+ invulnerable save.</p>

<h2><strong>Simulacrum Imperialis: </strong></h2>

<p>A unit with a Simulacrum Imperialis can attempt to use its Act of Faith twice during a battle instead of just once, regardless of whether or not the first attempt resulted in a passed or failed Leadership test. Note, however, that a unit can still only attempt to use one Act of Faith in the same phase. Also note that only the unit&rsquo;s Act of Faith can be attempted twice, not that of any Independent Characters that have joined the unit.</p>

<p>If a model with the Simulacrum Imperialis is removed as a casualty, its unit cannot attempt to use their Act of Faith for the rest of the battle (but any Independent Characters that have joined the unit that can use an Act of Faith can still attempt to do so).</p>

<h2><strong>Storm Shield: </strong></h2>

<p>A storm shield confers a 3+ invulnerable save. In addition, a model equipped with a storm shield can never claim the +1 Attack gained for being armed with two Melee weapons in an assault.</p>
