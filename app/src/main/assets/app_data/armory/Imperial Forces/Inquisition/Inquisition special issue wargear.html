<p><strong>Rules for the following wargear are found in the Warhammer 40,000 rulebook.</strong></p>

<p>Frag grenades, krak grenades, melta bombs.</p>

<h2><strong>DEFENCE ORBS</strong></h2>

<p>Defence orbs confer a 5+ invulnerable save.</p>

<h2><strong>DIGITAL WEAPONS</strong></h2>

<p>A model armed with digital weapons can re-roll a single failed roll To Wound in each Assault Phase.</p>

<h2><strong>EMPYREAN BRAIN MINES</strong></h2>

<p>Empyrean brain mines are used in the Assault phase, after assault moves have been made but before any blows are struck. Nominate one enemy model in base contact with the bearer. That model must pass an Initiative test to avoid the brain mine. If the test is passed, the effects of the brain mine have been resisted. If the test is failed, the victim has been rendered momentarily catatonic and cannot strike any blows during this Assault phase.</p>

<h2><strong>PSYBOLT AMMUNITION</strong></h2>

<p>A model equipped with psybolt ammunition counts the Strength of its shots as being one point higher than normal if it is firing one of the following weapons: bolt pistol, boltgun, storm bolter, heavy bolter, hurricane bolter, autocannon or assault cannon. E.g. an assault cannon would be Strength 7, rather than Strength 6, if the firer had psybolt ammunition.</p>

<h2><strong>PSYCHOTROKE GRENADES</strong></h2>

<p>When a unit equipped with psychotroke grenades launches an assault, or is assaulted, roll a D6 for each enemy unit being assaulted or assaulting to see what the effect is. The effects of psychotroke gas only ever last for the duration of a single Assault phase. Note that the descriptions included below have been based on the recorded responses of human subjects &ndash; alien races will, of course, react in the own, inimitable fashion (though the game effect is unchanged).</p>

<h3><strong>D6 - Effect</strong></h3>

<p><strong>1 - What&rsquo;s this? Smells a bit odd.</strong></p>

<p>The unit has resisted the psychotroke gas &ndash; there is no effect.</p>

<p><strong>2 - Suddenly, it&rsquo;s all so clear. The fighting, your allies, that mortal wound &ndash; everything&rsquo;s just a huge cosmic joke! Best to sit down and have a good laugh about it.</strong></p>

<p>The enemy unit is hit automatically in this Assault phase. They can still fight, but with a maximum of 1 Attack per model (to represent their maddened flailing).</p>

<p><strong>3 - Hah! Those enemies aren&rsquo;t real, they&rsquo;re just an illusion &ndash; you&rsquo;re not falling for that!</strong></p>

<p>You re-roll failed To Hit rolls against the enemy unit during this Assault phase.</p>

<p><strong>4 - They&rsquo;re horrible! Your darkest fears have been given form and are coming to kill you!</strong></p>

<p>The enemy unit is reduced to Leadership 2 for the remainder of the Assault phase.</p>

<p><strong>5 - The world is spinning &ndash; everything is all jumbled up. It&rsquo;s all you can do to keep your feet.</strong></p>

<p>The enemy unit is reduced to Initiative 1 for the remainder of the Assault phase.</p>

<p><strong>6 - They say they&rsquo;re your friends, but they&rsquo;re not &ndash; they&rsquo;re out to get you. Best get them first!</strong></p>

<p>Every model in the enemy unit must immediately take an Initiative test. Any models that fail must strike blows against their own unit during this Assault phase, rather than against the enemy, exactly as if they were on your side. Wounds inflicted must be allocated amongst the entire unit, not just amongst unaffected models. Unsaved wounds caused by affected models count towards your close combat total. Units composed of single models re-roll this result.</p>

<h2><strong>PSYK-OUT GRENADES</strong></h2>

<p>When a unit equipped with psyk-out grenades launches an assault, any models with the Daemon, Psyker, Psychic Pilot or Brotherhood of Psykers special rules in the assaulted unit(s) are reduced to Initiative 1 for the remainder of the phase.</p>

<h2><strong>PSYOCCULUM</strong></h2>

<p>The bearer of a psyocculum (and his unit) count as being Ballistic Skill 10 if shooting at a unit containing one or more models with the Psyker, Psychic Pilot or Brotherhood of Psykers/Sorcerers special rules.</p>

<h2><strong>RAD GRENADES</strong></h2>

<p>During a turn in which a unit equipped with rad grenades launches an assault, or is assaulted, the enemy unit(s) suffer a -1 penalty to their Toughness until the end of the phase (this does affect the victims&rsquo; Instant Death threshold).</p>

<h2><strong>ROSARIUS</strong></h2>

<p>A rosarius confers a 4+ invulnerable save.</p>

<h2><strong>SERVO-SKULLS</strong></h2>

<p>Servo-skulls are treated as counters, rather than units, for all intents and purposes. They are placed on the battlefield after deployment areas have been determined, but before any forces are deployed. Each Servo-skull can be placed anywhere on the battlefield outside the enemy&rsquo;s deployment zone. Once deployed, Servo-skulls do not move.</p>

<p>Enemy infiltrators cannot set up within 12&quot; of a Servo-skull. Similarly, enemy scouts cannot use their pre-game move to approach to within 12&quot; of a Servo-skull. A friendly unit arriving by Deep Strike rolls one D6 less for scatter if it aims to arrive within 12&quot; of a Servo-skull. Likewise, friendly blast templates placed within 12&quot; of a Servo-skull roll one D6 less for scatter.</p>

<p>Servo-skulls are considered too small and agile to be attacked and cannot be harmed in any way. However, should an enemy unit move within 6&quot; of a Servo-skull, then the Servoskull will self-destruct or flee the battlefield &ndash; remove it from play.</p>

<h2><strong>STORM SHIELD</strong></h2>

<p>A storm shield confers a 3+ invulnerable save. In addition, a model equipped with a storm shield can never claim the +1 Attack gained for being armed with two Melee weapons in an assault.</p>

<h2><strong>ULUMEATHI PLASMA SYPHON</strong></h2>

<p>Models firing plasma weapons (as defined in the Warhammer 40,000 rulebook) while within 12&quot; of a model with an Ulumeathi Plasma Syphon will count as Ballistic Skill 1.</p>
