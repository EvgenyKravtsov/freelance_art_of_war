<p><strong>Inquisitorial Relics are items of incredible rarity, tomes of knowledge whose mere existence is a secret to all but the highest-ranking members of the Ordos. Only one of each of the following relics can be chosen per army.</strong></p>

<h2><strong>Liber Heresius</strong></h2>

<p>At the start of any friendly turn, the bearer can take a Leadership test. If the test is failed, nothing happens, but if the test if passed, choose one of the special rules from the list below. The bearer of the Liber Heresius, and his unit, gain that special rule until the start of their next turn. The same special rule cannot be gained in this way more than once per game &ndash; you must choose a different special rule each time.</p>

<p>Scouts <strong style="color:#0000ff">*</strong></p>

<p>Split-fire</p>

<p>Counter-attack</p>

<p>Fear</p>

<p>Hatred</p>

<p><strong style="color:#0000ff">*</strong> Instead of being made at the start of a friendly turn, the Leadership test to use this special rule is made after deployment, but before the first turn begins.</p>

<h2><strong>Grimoire of True Names</strong></h2>

<p>When the bearer of the Grimoire of True Names is fighting a challenge against a model with the Daemon special rule, his opponent suffers a 5 penalty to his Weapon Skill, Initiative and Leadership characteristics (to a minimum of 1).</p>

<h2><strong>The Tome of Vethric</strong></h2>

<p>If your opponent&rsquo;s army contains any detachments chosen from any of the codexes shown in the table below, the bearer of the Tome of Vethric gains the corresponding special rule. For example, if your opponent had a primary detachment chosen from Codex: Tau Empire and an Allied Detachment chosen from Codex: Eldar, the bearer would have both the Furious Charge and Split Fire special rules.</p>

<p><strong>Enemy detachment&rsquo;s codex - Special rule gained by bearer</strong></p>

<p>Dark Eldar - Night Vision</p>

<p>Eldar - Split Fire</p>

<p>Orks - Counter-attack</p>

<p>Necrons - Tank Hunter</p>

<p>Tau Empire - Furious Charge</p>

<p>Tyranids - Monster Hunter</p>
