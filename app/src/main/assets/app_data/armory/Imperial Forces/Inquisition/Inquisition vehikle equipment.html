<p><strong>Rules for the following vehicle upgrades are found in the Warhammer 40,000 rulebook.</strong></p>

<p>Dozer blade, extra armour, hunter-killer missile, searchlight, smoke launchers.</p>

<h2><strong>FRAG ASSAULT LAUNCHERS</strong></h2>

<p>Any unit charging into close combat on the same turn it disembarks from a Land Raider Crusader or Land Raider Redeemer counts as having frag grenades.</p>

<h2><strong>PSYFLAME AMMUNITION</strong></h2>

<p>A model equipped with psyflame ammunition counts the strength of its shots as one higher than normal if it is firing one of the following weapons: flamer, heavy flamer or flamestorm cannon. For example, a heavy flamer would be Strength 6, rather than Strength 5.</p>

<h2><strong>TRUESILVER ARMOUR</strong></h2>

<p>If a model with the Daemon, Psyker, Brotherhood of Psykers/Sorcerers or Psychic Pilot special rules succeeds in hitting this vehicle in close combat, it suffers a Strength 6 hit for each hit once damage has been resolved against the vehicle.</p>
