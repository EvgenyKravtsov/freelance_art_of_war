<p><strong style="color:#0000ff">*See assault grenades.</strong></p>

<h2><strong>BRUTE SHIELD</strong></h2>

<p>A brute shield confers a 5+ invulnerable save. In addition, a model with a brute shield re-rolls failed To Wound rolls when resolving Hammer of Wrath hits.</p>

<h2><strong>CAMO GEAR</strong></h2>

<p>A model with camo gear counts its cover save as being 1 point better than normal. Note that this means it always has a cover save of at least 6+, even in the open.</p>

<h2><strong>MEDI-PACK</strong></h2>

<p>A unit that contains at least one model with a medi-pack has the Feel No Pain special rule.</p>

<h2><strong>PLATOON STANDARD</strong></h2>

<p>A unit that contains a model with a platoon standard counts as scoring an additional Wound for the purposes of calculating assault results.</p>

<h2><strong>REFRACTOR FIELD</strong></h2>

<p>A refractor field confers a 5+ invulnerable save.</p>

<h2><strong>REGIMENTAL STANDARD</strong></h2>

<p>A regimental standard follows the same rules as a platoon standard. In addition, any friendly units from Codex: Astra Militarum within 12&quot; of a model with a regimental standard re-roll failed Morale, Fear and Pinning tests.</p>

<h2><strong>ROSARIUS</strong></h2>

<p>A rosarius confers a 4+ invulnerable save.</p>

<h2><strong>SLABSHIELD</strong></h2>

<p>If a model with a slabshield is in base contact with one or more models with a slabshield from the same unit, it adds +1 to its Armour Save. Furthermore, if a target (friend or foe) is partially obscured from the firer&rsquo;s view by at least one model with a slabshield, it receives +1 to its cover save.</p>

<h2><strong>SNARE MINES</strong></h2>

<p>Enemy units that charge a unit with snare mines count as having made a disordered charge.</p>

<h2><strong>VOX-CASTER</strong></h2>

<p>Failed Leadership tests for orders issued to a unit with a vox-caster can be re-rolled, provided the officer&rsquo;s unit also has a vox-caster. An officer may not use a vox-caster&rsquo;s ability on his own unit.</p>
