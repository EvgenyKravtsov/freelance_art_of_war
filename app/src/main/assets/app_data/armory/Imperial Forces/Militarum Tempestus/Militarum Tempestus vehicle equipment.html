<h1><strong>MILITARUM TEMPESTUS VEHICLE EQUIPMENT</strong></h1>

<p><strong>Rules for the following vehicle upgrades can be found in the Warhammer 40,000 rulebook:</strong></p>

<p>Dozer blade, Extra armour, Heavy stubber, Hunter-killer missile, Searchlight, Smoke launchers, Storm bolter.</p>

<h2><strong>AUGUR ARRAY</strong></h2>

<p>If you attempt to bring a unit on from reserve using Deep Strike, and the location chosen for its deployment is within 6&quot; of a vehicle with an augur array, that unit does not scatter.</p>

<h2><strong>CAMO NETTING</strong></h2>

<p>A vehicle with camo netting counts its cover save as being 1 point better than normal. Note that this means it always has a cover save of at least 6+, even if it is in the open.</p>

<h2><strong>FIRE BARRELS</strong></h2>

<p>The first time an enemy unit attempts to charge a vehicle, with fire barrels, that unit suffers D6 Strength 4 AP5 hits. These hits are Randomly Allocated.</p>

<h2><strong>RECOVERY GEAR</strong></h2>

<p>If a vehicle with recovery gear is Immobilised, then in subsequent turns it may attempt to repair itself. To make the attempt, roll a D6 at the end of the Movement phase; on the roll of a 6, the vehicle is no longer Immobilised. Note that this does not restore a Hull Point.</p>

<h2><strong>RELIC PLATING</strong></h2>

<p>A vehicle with the relic plating upgrade has the Adamantium Will special rule.</p>
