<p><strong>Rules for the following upgrade can be found in Warhammer 40,000: The Rules:</strong></p>

<p>Extra armour</p>

<h1><strong>&rsquo;Ard Case</strong></h1>

<p>A vehicle with an &rsquo;ard case no longer counts as Open-topped. Note that this affects its Access Points and Fire Points as detailed in the appropriate datasheet entry.</p>

<h1><strong>Boarding Plank</strong></h1>

<p>If a unit disembarks from an Open-topped vehicle with a boarding plank and declares a charge in the same turn, it adds +2 to its charge distance (to a maximum of 12).</p>

<h1><strong>Deff Rolla</strong></h1>

<p>A vehicle with a deff rolla treats its front armour as two higher than normal when Ramming. In addition, if an enemy unit makes a Death or Glory attack on a vehicle with a deff rolla and fails to stop it, then the unit suffers D3 Strength 10 AP4 hits in addition to the damage they normally suffer for the failed attack. Furthermore, a vehicle with a deff rolla can re-roll failed Dangerous Terrain tests.</p>

<h1><strong>Grabbin&rsquo; Klaw</strong></h1>

<p>At the beginning of the enemy Movement phase, nominate a single enemy vehicle that is within 2&quot; of the vehicle&rsquo;s grabbin&rsquo; klaw. On the roll of a 4+, that vehicle may not move this turn. Flyers and Skimmers cannot be attacked by a grabbin&rsquo; klaw.</p>

<h1><strong>Flyboss</strong></h1>

<p>A vehicle with a Flyboss has Ballistic Skill 3 when shooting at Jetbikes, Skimmers, Flyers or Flying Monstrous Creatures.</p>

<h1><strong>Grot Riggers</strong></h1>

<p>A vehicle with grot riggers has the It Will Not Die special rule.</p>

<h1><strong>Red Paint Job</strong></h1>

<p>Ork vehicles with red paint jobs add +1&quot; to their move when they move Flat Out.</p>

<h1><strong>Reinforced Ram</strong></h1>

<p>A vehicle with a reinforced ram can Tank Shock and Ram, and treats its front Armour Value as two higher than normal when Ramming. Furthermore, the vehicle may re-roll failed Dangerous Terrain tests.</p>

<h1><strong>Stikkbomb Chukka</strong></h1>

<p>The vehicle is armed with stikkbombs. Any unit disembarking from a vehicle with a stikkbomb chukka is treated as having stikkbombs for the remainder of that turn.</p>

<h1><strong>Wreckin&rsquo; Ball</strong></h1>
