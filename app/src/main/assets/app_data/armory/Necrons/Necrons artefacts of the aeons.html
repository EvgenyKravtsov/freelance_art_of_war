<h1><strong>ARTEFACTS OF THE AEONS</strong></h1>

<p><strong>Artefacts of the Aeons are items of terrifying power, and each is older than many of the lesser races themselves. Only one of each of the following relics may be chosen per army.</strong></p>

<h2><strong>The Gauntlet of the Conflagrator</strong></h2>

<p>The Gauntlet of the Conflagrator is a Flamer weapon for the purposes of any special rules that interact with Flamer weapons as described in Warhammer 40,000: The Rules.</p>

<h2><strong>The Nightmare Shroud</strong></h2>

<p>The Nightmare Shroud confers a 2+ Armour Save and the Fear special rule. In addition, once per game, during any friendly Shooting phase, the bearer can choose one enemy unit within 18&quot;. That unit must immediately take a Morale check (units with the Fearless or And They Shall Know No Fear special rule automatically pass this test).</p>

<h2><strong>The Orb of Eternity</strong></h2>

<p>The Orb of Eternity can be activated once per game, immediately after an unsuccessful Reanimation Protocols roll has been made for the bearer of the Orb of Eternity or another model in the same unit. You can re-roll the failed Reanimation Protocols roll, and any further failed Reanimation Protocols rolls made for the bearer or any other model in the same unit, until the end of the phase. Furthermore, when the Orb of Eternity is activated, all Reanimation Protocols rolls made for the bearer or any other model in the same unit receive a +1 bonus until the end of the phase, including re-rolled Reanimation Protocols rolls.</p>

<h2><strong>The Solar Staff</strong></h2>

<p><strong>Solar Pulse:</strong> Once per game, at the start of any turn, the bearer can use this special rule. When he does, the Night Fighting rules are not in effect for the remainder of the turn (if they were in effect). In addition, when this special rule is used, enemy units targeting the bearer or his unit can only fire Snap Shots until the start of the bearer&rsquo;s next turn.</p>

<h2><strong>The Veil of Darkness</strong></h2>

<p>The bearer of the Veil of Darkness has the Deep Strike special rule. In addition, once per game, at the start of any friendly Movement phase, the bearer can use the Veil of Darkness to remove himself and his unit from the table, even if they are locked in combat. They then immediately arrive anywhere on the board using the rules for Deep Strike.</p>
