<h1><strong>Eternity Gate</strong></h1>

<p>At the start of each friendly turn, you may choose one friendly unit with the Necrons Faction consisting entirely of models with either the Infantry or Jump Infantry unit type that is in Reserves, Ongoing Reserves, or is on the table and not locked in combat. If the chosen unit is in Reserves or Ongoing Reserves, it automatically arrives this turn (no dice roll is required) and it is placed as if it were disembarking from the Monolith&rsquo;s portal at the start of the Movement phase.</p>

<p>If the chosen unit is currently on the battlefield, it is first removed from the table and then placed as described above. Any models that cannot be placed are removed as casualties, but the unit is otherwise treated exactly as if it were disembarking from a Transport vehicle.</p>

<h1><strong>Quantum Shielding</strong></h1>

<p>A vehicle equipped with active quantum shielding counts all of its Front and Side Armour Values as 13. A vehicle&rsquo;s quantum shielding is active until it suffers a penetrating hit, at which point it immediately deactivates. For the remainder of the battle after a vehicle&rsquo;s quantum shielding deactivates, all subsequent hits against that vehicle (including hits made from subsequent shooting attacks in the same phase &ndash; either from a different weapon or a different unit &ndash; or hits made at a lower Initiative step in close combat) are treated as though the vehicle was not equipped with quantum shielding.</p>
