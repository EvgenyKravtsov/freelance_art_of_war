<p><strong>Rules for the following grenades can be found in the Warhammer 40,000 rule book:</strong></p>

<p>Photon grenades*</p>

<p>EMP grenades**</p>

<p><em>*see defensive grenades </em></p>

<p><em>**see haywire grenades</em></p>

<h2><strong>ADVANCED TARGETING SYSTEM</strong></h2>

<p>Any To Hit roll of a 6 made in the Shooting phase by a model with an advanced targeting system is a Precision Shot. If a character has an advanced targeting system, any To Hit roll of 5 or 6 they make in the Shooting phase is a Precision shot.</p>

<h2><strong>BLACKSUN FILTER</strong></h2>

<p>A model with a blacksun filter has the Night Vision special rule and is immune to the effects of the Blind special rule.</p>

<h2><strong>COUNTERFIRE DEFENCE SYSTEM</strong></h2>

<p>A model with a counterfire defence system fires Overwatch at Ballistic Skill 2, rather than Ballistic Skill 1.</p>

<h2><strong>DRONE CONTROLLER</strong></h2>

<p>All Gun Drones, Marker Drones and Sniper Drones in the same unit as a model with a drone controller use the bearer&#39;s Ballistic Skill instead of their own. If a unit contains several Drone Controllers, use the highest Ballistic Skill amongst the bearers.</p>

<h2><strong>EARLY WARNING OVERRIDE</strong></h2>

<p>All weapons on a model with an early warning override have the Interceptor special rule.</p>

<h2><strong>HOMING BEACON</strong></h2>

<p>Friendly units arriving by Deep Strike do not scatter as long as the first model is placed within 6&quot; of a model with a homing beacon.</p>

<h2><strong>GRAVITY WAVE PROJECTOR</strong></h2>

<p>At the start of the enemy Assault phase, nominate an enemy unit within 12&quot; and then roll a D3. If during that Assault phase, the nominated unit attempts to assault the Grav-inhibitor Drone, or its unit, reduce that unit&#39;s assault move by the result of the D3 (to a minimum of 0) .</p>

<h2><strong>MULTI-TRACKER</strong></h2>

<p>A model with a multi-tracker can fire an additional weapon in each Shooting phase.</p>

<h2><strong>NETWORKED MARKERLIGHT</strong></h2>

<p>Networked markerlights are a specialised version of the standard markerlight system. When a unit with one or more networked markerlights makes a Shooting attack, the networked markerlights are always fired first. Once the shots from the networked markerlights are resolved, the unit can then fire their other weapons. This means that (unlike other units) they can expend markerlight counters placed from their own networked markerlights in order to benefit their other weapons.</p>

<h2><strong>PULSE ACCELERATOR</strong></h2>

<p>All pulse weapons in a unit that contains at least one pulse accelerator, increase their maximum range by 6&quot;.</p>

<h2><strong>POSITIONAL RELAY</strong></h2>

<p>Whilst the bearer is within 6&quot; of a board edge, any friendly unit from Codex: Tau Empire that arrives from reserve using the Outflank special rule, can choose to move on from that board edge (even if it is your, or your opponent&#39;s board edge). Outflanking units that do not choose to arrive from that board edge arrive using the Outflank special rule, as detailed in the Warhammer 40,000 rulebook.</p>

<h2><strong>PULSE BOMB GENERATOR</strong></h2>

<p>Immediately after the Sun Shark makes a bombing run, roll a D6. On a score of 2+, another pulse bomb is created and the Sun Shark can make another bombing run later in the game. On a roll of a 1, the pulse bomb generator&#39;s power fails - no more bombs can be created, and no more bombing runs can therefore be performed.</p>

<h2><strong>RIPTIDE SHIELD GENERATOR</strong></h2>

<p>A Riptide shield generator confers a 5+ invulnerable save.</p>

<h2><strong>SHIELD GENERATOR</strong></h2>

<p>A shield generator confers a 4+ invulnerable Save.</p>

<h2><strong>STIMULANT INJECTOR</strong></h2>

<p>A model with a stimulant injector has the Feel No Pain special rule.</p>

<h2><strong>TARGET LOCK</strong></h2>

<p>A model with a target lock can shoot at a different target to the rest of his unit.</p>

<h2><strong>VECTORED RETRO-THRUSTERS</strong></h2>

<p>A model with vectored retro-thrusters has both the Fleet and Hit &amp; Run special rules. Models in XV88 Battlesuits cannot be equipped with vectored retro-thrusters.</p>

<h2><strong>VELOCITY TRACKER</strong></h2>

<p>A model with a velocity tracker can choose whether or not to have the Skyfire special rule each time he makes a shooting attack (choose once for all weapons).</p>
