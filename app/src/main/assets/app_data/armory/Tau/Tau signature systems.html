<h2><strong>COMMAND AND CONTROL NODE</strong></h2>

<p>If a model with this wargear does not shoot during the Shooting phase, all Shooting attacks made by other models in his unit re-roll failed To Hit rolls until the end of the current phase. This cannot be used when firing Overwatch. A Command and Control Node can be used at the same time as a Multi spectrum Sensor Suite.</p>

<h2><strong>FAILSAFE DETONATOR</strong></h2>

<p>If a model with a Failsafe Detonator is slain in the Assault phase, centre the large blast marker over him immediately before removing the model as a casualty. All units, friend and foe, suffer a number of Strength 5 AP- hits equal to the number of models from their unit that are at least partially under the template. Unsaved Wounds inflicted by a Failsafe Detonator count towards determining the assault results.</p>

<h2><strong>MULTI-SPECTRUM SENSOR SUITE</strong></h2>

<p>If a model with a Multi-spectrum Sensor Suite does not shoot in the Shooting phase, all Shooting attacks made by other models in his unit gain the Ignores Cover special rule until the end of the current phase. This cannot be used when firing Overwatch. A Multispectrum Sensor Suite can be used at the same time as a Command and Control Node.</p>

<h2><strong>ONAGER GAUNTLET</strong></h2>

<p>During the Fight sub-phase, a model with the Onager Gauntlet can opt to substitute all his close combat attacks for a single Strength 10 AP1 attack.</p>

<h2><strong>NEUROWEB SYSTEM JAMMER</strong></h2>

<p>At the start of each enemy Shooting phase, a model with a Neuroweb System jammer can use it to target a single enemy unit within 12&quot;. All shooting weapons in the target unit gain the Gets Hot special rule until the end of the phase.</p>

<h2><strong>PURETIDE ENGRAM NEUROCHIP</strong></h2>

<p>At the start of the bearer&#39;s Movement phase, choose one of the following special rules: Counter-attack, Furious Charge, Monster Hunter, Stubborn or Tank Hunter. The model with the Puretide Engram Neurochip has that special rule until the start of his next Movement phase.</p>

<h2><strong>REPULSOR IMPACT FIELD</strong></h2>

<p>At the start of the Fight sub-phase, at the Initiative 10 step, the Repulsor Impact Field inflicts D6 Strength 4 AP- hits on each enemy unit that successfully completed a charge against the bearer, or his unit, this turn.</p>

<h2><strong>XVB-02 CRISIS &#39;IRIDIUM&#39; BATTLESUIT</strong></h2>

<p>A model with an XVS-02 Crisis &#39;Iridium&#39; Battlesuit has +1 Toughness and an Armour Save of 2+. They otherwise follow all of the rules for XVS Crisis battlesuits.</p>
