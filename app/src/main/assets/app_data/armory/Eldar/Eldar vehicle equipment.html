<h1><strong>ELDAR VEHICLE EQUIPMENT</strong></h1>

<h2><strong>CRYSTAL TARGETING MATRIX</strong></h2>

<p>One use only. A non-Walker vehicle with this upgrade can fire one weapon, at the vehicle&rsquo;s full Ballistic Skill, after moving Flat Out in the Shooting phase.</p>

<h2><strong>GHOSTWALK MATRIX</strong></h2>

<p>A vehicle with this upgrade has the Move Through Cover special rule.</p>

<h2><strong>HOLO-FIELDS</strong></h2>

<p>A vehicle with holo-fields has a 5+ invulnerable save unless it is Immobilised.</p>

<h2><strong>MINDSHOCK POD</strong></h2>

<p>Enemy models within 12&quot; of a model equipped with a mindshock pod subtract 2 from their Leadership when taking Morale, Pinning and Fear tests.</p>

<h2><strong>POWER FIELD</strong></h2>

<p>A model with this upgrade has a 5+ invulnerable save.</p>

<h2><strong>SPIRIT STONES</strong></h2>

<p>A vehicle with this upgrade ignores Crew Shaken results on a roll of 2+ and Crew Stunned results on a roll of 4+. Roll immediately when the result is suffered.</p>

<h2><strong>SERPENT SHIELD</strong></h2>

<p>All penetrating hits inflicted against the front or side armour of a vehicle equipped with a serpent shield are downgraded to glancing hits on a D6 roll of 2+. Once per game, the serpent shield can be used as a weapon in the controlling player&rsquo;s Shooting phase, with the profile below. This is treated as a hull-mounted weapon that is pointing forward.</p>

</table>

<p>For the remainder of the battle after the shooting attack has been resolved, all subsequent hits against the vehicle are treated as though the vehicle was not equipped with a serpent shield.</p>

<h2><strong>STAR ENGINES</strong></h2>

<p>A non-Walker vehicle with this upgrade can move up to 24&quot; when moving Flat Out. A Walker with this upgrade instead Runs an additional 3&quot; (this will normally be D6+3&quot;).</p>

<h2><strong>VECTORED ENGINES</strong></h2>

<p>Unless it is Immobilised, a vehicle with this upgrade can pivot to face any direction immediately after resolving its shooting attack (in the Shooting phase).</p>
