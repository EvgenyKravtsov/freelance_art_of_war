<h1><strong>TREASURES OF VAUL</strong></h1>

<h2><strong>BANSHEE MASK</strong></h2>

<p>A model equipped with a banshee mask causes Fear. In addition, models cannot fire Overwatch against units that contain at least one model equipped with a banshee mask.</p>

<h2><strong>ELDAR JETBIKE</strong></h2>

<p>A model riding an Eldar jetbike has a 3+ Armour Save and a twin-linked shuriken catapult. Their unit type also changes to Eldar Jetbike (see Warhammer 40,000: The Rules).</p>

<h2><strong>FORCESHIELD</strong></h2>

<p>A model with a forceshield has a 4+ invulnerable save.</p>

<h2><strong>GHOSTHELM</strong></h2>

<p>If a model with a ghosthelm suffers an unsaved Wound from Perils of the Warp, he can prevent it by immediately expending a Warp Charge point (if he has one).</p>

<h2><strong>GRENADE PACK</strong></h2>

<p>Any time a unit with a grenade pack enters play by Deep Strike and does not suffer a Deep Strike mishap, nominate one model in the unit immediately after it arrives. That model can make a single special shooting attack in the Movement phase with the profile below &ndash; this represents the unit&rsquo;s grenade pack attack. A unit that fires grenade packs in the Movement phase can still shoot in the subsequent Shooting phase; however, it must target the same target unit if possible.</p>

<p><strong>Skyburst:</strong> This shooting attack does not need line of sight. If the unit consists of at least six models with a grenade pack, the attack has the Large Blast special rule instead of the Blast special rule.</p>

<h2><strong>HEAVY WEAPON PLATFORM</strong></h2>

<p>One Guardian from the same unit as, and within 2&quot; of, a Heavy Weapon Platform may fire the platform instead of his shuriken catapult, counting as having the Relentless special rule. If there are no Guardians left in the unit, remove the heavy weapons platform as a casualty. Weapons platform models are ignored when allocating Wounds from Look Out, Sir rolls.</p>

<h2><strong>MANDIBLASTERS</strong></h2>

<p>During the Fight sub-phase, at the start of the Initiative 10 step, roll a D6 for each model equipped with mandiblasters. On a result of 4+, an enemy unit that is engaged with the model (attacking player&rsquo;s choice) suffers a single Wound (saving throws can be taken as normal). Gargantuan Creatures suffer a Wound on a result of 6+ instead of 4+. If a character equipped with mandiblasters is fighting in a challenge, the Wound must be allocated to his opponent.</p>

<h2><strong>REAPER RANGEFINDER</strong></h2>

<p>Enemies cannot take Jink saves against shots fired by a model equipped with a reaper rangefinder.</p>

<h2><strong>SCATTERSHIELD</strong></h2>

<p>The bearer has a 5+ invulnerable save. Whenever the bearer passes one or more saving throws using its scattershield, all enemy units within 6&quot; must test as if they had just been hit by a weapon with the Blind special rule.</p>

<h2><strong>SHIMMERSHIELD</strong></h2>

<p>The bearer and his unit have a 5+ invulnerable save.</p>

<h2><strong>SWOOPING HAWK WINGS</strong></h2>

<p></p>

<h2><strong>PLASMA GRENADES</strong></h2>

<p>A model equipped with Swooping Hawk wings gains the Jump unit type as described in Warhammer 40,000: The Rules. When a unit composed entirely of models equipped with Swooping Hawk wings uses its jump packs in the Movement phase, it can move up to 18&quot; instead of 12&quot;. Furthermore, the unit can choose to Skyleap instead of moving in the Movement phase, as long as it did not arrive from Reserves that turn and is not locked in combat or Falling Back. A Skyleaping unit is removed from the board and placed into Ongoing Reserve</p>

<h2><strong>WARP JUMP GENERATOR</strong></h2>

<p>A model equipped with a Warp jump generator gains the Jet Pack unit type as described in Warhammer 40,000: The Rules. In the Movement phase, a unit composed entirely of models equipped with Warp jump generators can choose to either move as Jet Pack Infantry or make a Warp jump. If making a Warp jump, it immediately moves up to 2D6+6&quot; in any direction (roll once per unit each turn), ignoring all intervening terrain and models. This move ignores dangerous terrain. If the 2D6 roll is a double 1, one member of the unit (randomly determined) is removed as a casualty. Warp jump cannot be used when the unit is Falling Back.</p>
