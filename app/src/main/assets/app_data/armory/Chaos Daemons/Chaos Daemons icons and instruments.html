<h3><strong>ICON OF CHAOS</strong></h3>

<p>When determining the assault result, add one to your total if there are one or more friendly units with an Icon of Chaos locked in that combat.</p>

<p>In addition, if the first model from a friendly unit arriving In Deep Strike is placed within 6&quot; of at least one model with an Icon of Chaos, the following rules apply:</p>

<p>&bull; If the unit attempting to Deep Strike and the unit with the Icon of Chaos have the same daemonic alignment (both units are entirely composed of models with the same Daemon of Khorne, Tzeentch, Nurgle or Slaanesh special rule) then the unit attempting to Deep Strike does not scatter.</p>

<p>&bull; If the unit attempting to Deep Strike and the unit with the Icon of Chaos have different daemonic alignments (as explained above) but are entirely composed of models with the Daemon special rule then the unit attempting to Deep Strike scatters D6&rdquo; rather than the usual amount.</p>

<p>&bull; If either the unit attempting to Deep Strike or the unit with the Icon of Chaos are not entirely composed of model with the Daemon special rule, the Icon of chaos has no additional effect.</p>

<h3><strong>BANNER OF BLOOD</strong></h3>

<p>A banner of blood is an Icon of Chaos. Once per game, the unit bearing the banner of blood can charge 6+D6&quot; instead of the usual amount. Declare you are using the banner of blood before the charge distance is rolled.</p>

<h3><strong>BLASTED STANDARD</strong></h3>

<p>A blasted standard is an Icon of chaos. Once per game, the unit can declare it is using its blasted standard. This is done immediately before the unit makes a Shooting attack (including Overwatch) or attempts to manifest a Witchfire power. If it does so, any unit hit by that attack suffers an additional 2D6 Strength 4 AP- hits.</p>

<h3><strong>PLAGUE BANNER</strong></h3>

<p>A plague banner is an Icon of Chaos. Once per game, at the start of the Fight sub-phase, the unit can declare it is using the plague banner. If it does so, its melee weapons have the Poisoned (2+) special rule until the end of the phase.</p>

<h3><strong>PRAPTUROUS STANDARD</strong></h3>

<p>A rapturous standard is an Icon of Chaos. Once per game, at the start of the Fight sub-phase, the unit can declare it is using the rapturous standard. If the unit does so, all models locked in combat with the unit with the rapturous standard suffer a &ndash;D3 penalty to their Weapon Skill. This cannot reduce their Weapon Skill below 1 and lasts until the end of the phase. Models that have the Mark of Slaanesh or the Daemon of Slaanesh special rule are immune to the effects of the rapturous standard.</p>

<h3><strong>INSTRUMENT OF CHAOS</strong></h3>

<p>When a unit with an Instrument of Chaos in Deep Strike reserve successfully passes its Reserve Roll, you can also choose another Unit. This must be a unit that:</p>

<p>&bull; is entirely composed of models with the Daemon special rule</p>

<p>&bull; is still in Deep Strike reserve</p>

<p>&bull; has yet to make a reserve roll this turn</p>

<p>If you do so, the chosen unit automatically arrives from reserve. (no roll is made).</p>

<p>In addition, Instruments of Chaos can affect certain result, on the Warp Storm table as described below:</p>

<p>&bull; If, when you roll on the Warp Storm table you roll a Khorne&rsquo;s Wrath result, you may re-roll a single dice roll to determine if a unit is hit or not for each friendly Daemon of Khorne model with an Instrument of Chaos currently on the table.</p>

<p>&bull; If, when you roll on the Warp Storm table, you roll a Storm of Fire result, you may re-roll a single dice roll to determine if a unit is hit or not for each friendly Daemon of Tzeentch model with an Instrument of Chaos currently On the table.</p>

<p>&bull; If, when you roll on the Warp Storm table, you roll a Rot. Glorious Rot result, you may re-roll a single dice roll to determine if a unit is hit or not for each friendly Daemon of Nurgle model with an Instrument of Chaos currently on the table.</p>

<p>&bull; If, when you roll on the Warp Storm table tots roll a The Dark Prince Thirst, result, you may re-roll a single dice roll to determine if a unit is hit or not for each friendly Daemon of Slaanesh model with an Instrument of Chaos currently on the table.</p>
