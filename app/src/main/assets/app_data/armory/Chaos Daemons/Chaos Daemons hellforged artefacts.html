<p><strong>Gloryseeker:</strong> Roll a D3 at the start of each Fight sub-phase of a combat that the bearer is locked in &mdash; if attacking with the Eternal Blade, the bearer gains a bonus to his Weapon Skill. Initiative and Attacks characteristics equal to the result of the D3 until the end of the phase.</p>

<h2><strong>THE PORTALGLYPH</strong></h2>

<p>The Portalglyph can be placed once per game, at any point in any of your Movement phases. Place a small blast marker or other similar sized marker within 12&quot; of the bearer and scatter it 4D6&quot;. If the counter ends up off the board, or inside/within 1&rdquo; of a unit or impassable terrain, reduce the scatter distance by the minimum required to avoid the obstacle. Once placed, the portalglyph is treated as an immobilised vehicle with the following profile:</p>

<p>BS &ndash; 0</p>

<p>F &ndash; 12</p>

<p>S &ndash; 12</p>

<p>R &ndash; 12</p>

<p>HP- 1</p>

<p><strong>UNIT TYPE: </strong> Vehicle.</p>

<p><strong>SPECIAL RULES: </strong> Daemon.</p>

<p>At the end of each of your Movement phases after the Portalglyph has been placed, roll a D6. On a score of 4-6 a new unit (under your control) of D6 Daemons (your choice of Bloodletters, Pink Horrors, Plaguebearers or Daemonettes) enters play from the Portalglyph, exactly as if it were a unit disembarking from a transport. This unit has no upgrades, but otherwise is treated exactly as a normal unit of its type.</p>

<h2><strong>THE DOOMSTONE</strong></h2>

<p>At the start of each Fight sub-phase of a combat containing a model with the Doomstone, all enemy characters without the Daemon special rule in that combat must take a Leadership test. If the test is passed, nothing happens. If the test is failed, the character suffers a -D6 Leadership penalty for the remainder of the game. A model reduced to 0 Leadership in this manner is removed as a casualty with no saves of any kind allowed.</p>

<h2><strong>GRIMOIRE OF TRUE NAMES</strong></h2>

<p>The bearer of the Grimoire of True Names can use it at any point during his Movement phase. He can target either a friendly or an enemy unit. The target must be within 24&quot; and contain at lean one model with the Daemon special rule. If the target is an enemy, all models in the unit with the Daemon special rule suffer a -1 penalty to their invulnerable saves until the start of your next Movement phase.</p>
<pif a="" d6.="" friendly="" is="" p="" roll="" target="" the="">
<p>If the target is a friendly unit, roll a D6.</p>

<p>On a score of 1-2, the Daemon has been unable to overcome his temptation to belittle and punish his allies &mdash; all Daemon models in the unit (excluding the bearer of the Grimoire of True names) suffer a -1 penalty to their invulnerable saves until the start of your next Movement phase.</p>

<p>On a score of 3-6, the bearer has successfully followed through on his intentions to empower his allies &mdash; all Daemon models (excluding the bearer of the Grimoire of True Names) in the unit have a +2 bonus to their invulnerable saves until the start of your next Movement phase.</p>
