<h1><strong>SPECIAL ISSUE WARGEAR</strong></h1>

<p><strong>Rules for the following items can be found in Warhammer 40,000: The Rules: frag grenades (see assault grenades), krak grenades, melta bombs, psychic hood.</strong></p>

<h2><strong>BROTHERHOOD BANNER</strong></h2>

<p>Friendly units with the Grey Knights Faction within 12&quot; of the bearer re-roll failed Morale checks and Pinning tests. All models with the Grey Knights Faction in the same unit as the bearer have +1 Attack whilst the bearer is alive.</p>

<h2><strong>DIGITAL WEAPONS</strong></h2>

<p>A model armed with digital weapons can re-roll a single failed roll To Wound in each Assault Phase.</p>

<h2><strong>NARTHECIUM</strong></h2>

<p>As long as the bearer is alive, all models in his unit have the Feel No Pain special rule.</p>

<h2><strong>IRON HALO</strong></h2>

<p>An iron halo confers a 4+ invulnerable save.</p>

<h2><strong>PERSONAL TELEPORTER</strong></h2>

<p>Models with a personal teleporter add the Jump type to their unit type. For example, an Infantry model with a personal teleporter becomes Jump Infantry, whilst a Monstrous Creature with a personal teleporter becomes Jump Monstrous Creature. In addition, once per game, a unit composed entirely of models with personal teleporters can make a teleport shunt instead of moving in the Movement phase. A unit making a teleport shunt moves up to 30&quot; in the Movement phase. This move cannot end up on another unit or impassable terrain, but ignores intervening units, terrain etc. A unit cannot charge in the same turn that it makes a teleport shunt.</p>

<h2><strong>PSYK-OUT GRENADES</strong></h2>

<h3><strong>Shooting</strong></h3>

<p>When a unit armed with psyk-out grenades makes a shooting attack, one model can choose to throw a grenade, rather than using another shooting weapon.</p>

<h3><strong>Psi-shock:</strong></h3>

<p>If a unit containing at least one Psyker (i.e. a model with the Psyker, Brotherhood of Psykers/Sorcerers or Psychic Pilot special rule) is hit by a weapon with the Psi-shock special rule, one randomly determined Psyker model in that unit suffers Perils of the Warp in addition to any other damage.</p>

<h3><strong>Assault</strong></h3>

<p>Models with the Psyker, Brotherhood of Psykers/Sorcerers or Psychic Pilot special rules that are charging a unit equipped with psyk-out grenades do not gain bonus Attacks from charging. However, if the charged unit was already locked in combat from a previous turn, or has gone to ground, these grenades have no effect and the attackers gain bonus Attacks as normal.</p>

<h2><strong>SERVO-HARNESS</strong></h2>

<p>A servo-harness gives the bearer two servo-arms, a plasma cutter and a flamer. In the Shooting phase, the bearer can fire both harness-mounted weapons, or one harness-mounted weapon and another weapon.</p>

<h2><strong>TELEPORT HOMER</strong></h2>

<p>Friendly units composed entirely of models in Terminator armour (including the Cuirass of Sacrifice) and/or models with a personal teleporter do not scatter when arriving from Deep Strike Reserve, so long as the first model is placed within 6&quot; of the teleport homer&rsquo;s bearer. For this to work, the bearer must have been on the battlefield at the start of the turn.</p>

<h2><strong>STORM SHIELD</strong></h2>

<p>A storm shield confers a 3+ invulnerable save. In addition, a model equipped with a storm shield can never claim the +1 Attack gained for being armed with two Melee weapons in an assault.</p>
