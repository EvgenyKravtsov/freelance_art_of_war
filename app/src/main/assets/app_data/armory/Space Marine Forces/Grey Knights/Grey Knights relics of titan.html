<h2><strong>RELICS OF TITAN</strong></h2>

<h3>Relics of Titan are items of incredible power with names and histories that are spoken of in the same reverent tones used to describe the Chapter&rsquo;s greatest heroes. Only one of each of the following artefacts may be chosen per army &ndash; there is only one of each of these items in the galaxy!</h3>

<h2><strong>BONE SHARD OF SOLOR</strong></h2>

<p>The bearer of the Bone Shard of Solor has a 3+ invulnerable save whilst within 12&quot; of at least one model with the Daemon special rule. This is increased to a 2+ invulnerable save whilst the bearer is within 12&quot; of at least one model with the Daemon of Khorne special rule. In addition, the bearer has the Hatred (Daemons of Khorne) special rule.</p>

<h2><strong>CUIRASS OF SACRIFICE</strong></h2>

<p>The Cuirass of Sacrifice is a suit of Terminator armour that confers a 2+ Armour Save and a 5+ invulnerable save. The wearer has the Bulky, Deep Strike, It Will Not Die, Feel No Pain and Relentless special rules, and cannot make Sweeping Advances.</p>

<h2><strong>DOMINA LIBER DAEMONICA</strong></h2>

<p>The bearer of the Domina Liber Daemonica knows one more psychic power than is normal for his Mastery Level. This additional psychic power must be generated from the Daemonology (Sanctic) discipline. In addition, the bearer, and any friendly units with the Grey Knights Faction within 6&quot; of the bearer, re-roll dice rolls of 1 when taking psychic tests when attempting to manifest psychic powers from the Daemonology discipline.</p>
