<h1><strong>RELIC OF THE DAMNED</strong></h1>

<h2><strong>The Animus Malorum</strong></h2>

<p>The bearer and all Legionnaire models in his unit have the Feel No Pain special rule. Furthermore, whenever an enemy unit fails a Fear, Pinning or Morale check within 12&rdquo; of the bearer, one randomly determined model in that unit is immediately removed as a casualty with no saves of any kind allowed (though Look Out, Sir rolls can be taken as normal). For each model slain in this manner, the bearer&rsquo;s unit receives a +1 modifier to their Feel No Pain rolls (to a maximum of 2+) until the end of the player turn.</p>
