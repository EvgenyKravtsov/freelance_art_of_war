<h1><strong>Special issue wargear:</strong></h1>

<h3><strong>Rules for the following items can be found in the Warhammer 40,000 rulebook.</strong></h3>

<p>Frag grenades*, krak grenades, melta bombs.</p>

<p>* See assault grenades</p>
<p><strong>ARMORIUM CHERUB: </strong>One use only. One model in a unit equipped with an armorium cherub can re-roll all
failed To Hit rolls in one Shooting phase. An armorium cherub is represented by a
separate miniature that will always remain as close as possible to the unit that selected it.
The model itself is purely decorative and is always ignored for game purposes – just move
it to one side if it gets in the way. Remove the armorium cherub once it has been used or
once the unit that selected it has been completely destroyed.</p>

<p><strong>AUSPEX: </strong>A model with an auspex can use it in place of making a shooting attack. If he does so,
target an enemy unit within 12" (this does not count as choosing a target for his unit to
shoot at). A unit that is targeted by one or more auspexes has its cover save reduced by 1
until the end of the phase.</p>

<p><strong>CHAPTER BANNER: </strong>Friendly units with the Dark Angels Faction within 12" of a model equipped with the
Chapter banner re-roll failed Morale checks, Pinning tests and Fear tests. In addition, all
friendly models with the Dark Angels Faction in the same unit as this banner have +1
Attack whilst the bearer is alive.</p>

<p><strong>COMPANY STANDARD: </strong>Friendly units with the Dark Angels Faction within 12" of a model equipped with the
company standard re-roll failed Morale checks, Pinning tests and Fear tests.</p>

<p><strong>COMBAT SHIELD: </strong>A combat shield confers a 6+ invulnerable save.</p>

<p><strong>CONVERSION FIELD: </strong>A conversion field confers a 4+ invulnerable save. At the end of a phase in which the
bearer passes one or more invulnerable saves granted by the conversion field, all units
within D6" of the bearer must test as if they had been hit by a weapon with the Blind
special rule. Friendly units can re-roll this test.</p>
<p><strong>DEATHWING COMPANY BANNER: </strong>Friendly units with the Dark Angels Faction within 12" of a model equipped with the
Deathwing Company Banner re-roll failed Morale checks, Pinning tests and Fear tests. In
addition, all friendly models with the Deathwing special rule in the same unit as this
banner have +1 Attack whilst the bearer is alive.</p>

<p><strong>DIGITAL WEAPONS</strong>A model armed with digital weapons can re-roll a single failed roll To Wound in each
Assault phase.</p>

<p><strong>GRAV-AMP</strong>When rolling to Wound with a grav-weapon, or to determine its effects on a vehicle, the
bearer can re-roll the result.</p>






<p><strong>IRON HALO: </strong>A model with an iron halo has a 4+ invulnerable save.</p>

<p><strong>JUMP PACK: </strong>Models equipped with jump packs gain the jump unit type as described in the Warhammer 40, 000 rule book.</p>

<p><strong>NARTHECIUM: </strong>As long as the Apothecary is alive, all models in his unit have the Feel No Pain special rule.</p>

<p><strong>DIGITAL WEAPONS: </strong>A model armed with digital weapons can re-roll a single failed roll To Wound in each Assault phase.</p>

<p><strong>PERFIDIOUS RELIC OF THE UNFORGIVEN: </strong>A perfidious relic of the Unforgiven is borne to battle by a Relic Bearer. A Relic Bearer is
represented by a separate miniature that will always remain as close as possible to the
unit that selected it. The model itself is purely decorative and is always ignored for game
purposes – just move it to one side if it gets in the way. Remove the Relic Bearer once the
unit that selected it has been completely destroyed.
Models in a unit that includes a Relic Bearer carrying a perfidious relic of the Unforgiven
have the Adamantium Will and Fear special rules.</p>

<p><strong>PSYCHIC HOOD: </strong>Each time a unit (or model) is targeted by an enemy psychic power and is within 12" of a
friendly model with a psychic hood, the wearer of the hood can attempt to Deny the Witch
in their stead, as if he were in the target unit. If the Deny the Witch attempt is failed, the
psychic power is resolved as normal, but effects only the initial target, not the wearer of
the hood.
If a model with a psychic hood is embarked in a vehicle or building, he can only use the
hood to nullify powers targeting the vehicle or building he is embarked within.</p>

<p><strong>RAVENWING COMPANY BANNER: </strong>Friendly units with the Dark Angels Faction within 12" of a model equipped with the
Ravenwing Company Banner re-roll failed Morale checks, Pinning tests and Fear tests. In
addition, all friendly models with the Ravenwing special rule in the same unit as this
banner automatically pass Initiative tests when attempting to Hit & Run and roll one
additional dice when determining the distance of a Hit & Run move whilst the bearer is
alive.</p>

<p><strong>SERVO-HARNESS: </strong>A servo-harness gives the bearer two servo-arms, a plasma cutter and a flamer. In the
Shooting phase, the bearer can fire both harness-mounted weapons, or one harnessmounted
weapon and another weapon.</p>

<h3><strong>Plasma cutter:</strong></h3>

<p><strong>SIGNUM: </strong>At the start of the Shooting phase, a model with a signum can choose to use it instead of
shooting. If he does so, one model in his unit is Ballistic Skill 5 for the remainder of the
Shooting phase. Declare that the signum is being used before any rolls To Hit are made.</p>

<p><strong>SPACE MARINE BIKE: </strong>Models equipped with Space Marine bikes change their unit type to Bike, as described in
Warhammer 40,000: The Rules. Space Marine bikes are fitted with a twin-linked boltgun.</p>

<p><strong>STORM SHIELD: </strong>A storm shield confers a 3+ invulnerable save. In addition, a model equipped with a storm
shield can never claim the +1 Attack for being armed with two Melee weapons in an assault.</p>

<p><strong>ROSARIUS: </strong>A model with a rosarius has a 4+ invulnerable save.</p>
<p><strong>SACRED STANDARD: </strong>Friendly units with the Dark Angels Faction within 12" of a model equipped with a sacred
standard re-roll failed Morale checks, Pinning tests and Fear tests. In addition, all friendly models with the Dark Angels Faction in the same unit as this banner have the Counterattack and Relentless special rules whilst the bearer is alive.</p>
<p><strong>TELEPORT HOMER: </strong>Friendly units composed entirely of models in Terminator armour do not scatter when
they Deep Strike, so long as the first model is placed within 6" of the teleport homer’s
bearer. For this to work, the bearer of the teleport homer must have been on the
battlefield at the start of the turn.</p>
