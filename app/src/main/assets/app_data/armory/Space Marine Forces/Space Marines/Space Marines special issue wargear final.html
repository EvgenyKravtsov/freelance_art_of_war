<h1><strong>Special issue wargear:</strong></h1>

<h3><strong>Rules for the following items can be found in the Warhammer 40,000 rulebook.</strong></h3>

<p>Frag grenades*, krak grenades, melta bombs, psychic hood.</p>

<p>* See assault grenades</p>

<p><strong>Auspex: </strong>A model with an auspex can use it in place of making a shooting attack. If he does so, target an enemy unit within 12&quot; (this does not count as choosing a target for his unit to shoot at). A unit that is targeted by one or more auspexes has its cover saves reduced by 1 until the end of the phase.</p>

<p><strong>Camo Cloak: </strong>A model wearing a camo cloak has +1 cover save. If it does not already have a cover save, it gains a 6+ cover save.</p>

<p><strong>Chapter Banner: </strong>Friendly units within 12&quot; of the bearer of the Chapter banner, and with the same Chapter Tactics, re-roll failed Morale checks and Pinning tests. In addition, all friendly Space Marines models in the same unit as this banner have +1 Attack whilst the bearer is alive.</p>

<p><strong>Cluster Mines: </strong>After your army deploys, Scouts redeploy and Infiltrators deploy, but before the roll to Seize the Initiative, each unit with cluster mines in your army may booby-trap a single piece of area terrain on the table. The piece of area terrain should be marked with a small marker (a coin will do) to remind both players that it has been booby-trapped. Enemy models treat booby-trapped pieces of area terrain as dangerous terrain. Note that having multiple units booby-trap the same piece of area terrain has no additional effect. A unit with cluster mines which begins the game in Reserve may still booby-trap a piece of area terrain.</p>

<p><strong>Combat Shield: </strong>A combat shield confers a 6+ invulnerable save.</p>

<p><strong>Company Standard: </strong>Friendly units within 12&quot; of the bearer, and with the same Chapter Tactics, re-roll failed Morale checks and Pinning tests.</p>

<p><strong>Digital Weapons: </strong>A model armed with digital weapons can re-roll a single failed roll To Wound in each Assault phase.</p>

<p><strong>Grav-amp: </strong>When rolling to Wound with a grav-weapon, or to determine its effects on a vehicle, the bearer can re-roll the result.</p>

<p><strong>Hellfire shells: </strong>Each time a weapon equipped with hellfire shells fires, the controlling player can choose whether to fire a hellfire shell or to use the ordinary profile for that weapon.</p>

<p><strong>Iron Halo: </strong>An iron halo confers a 4+ invulnerable save.</p>

<p><strong>Ironclad Assault Launchers: </strong>A model with ironclad assault launchers does not suffer the penalty to its Initiative for charging enemies through difficult terrain. Furthermore, enemies charging a model with ironclad assault launchers do not gain bonus Attacks from charging unless the model was already locked in combat from a previous turn.</p>

<p><strong>Jump Pack: </strong>Models equipped with jump packs gain the Jump unit type as described in the Warhammer 40,000 rulebook.</p>

<p><strong>Locator Beacon: </strong>Friendly units do not scatter when they Deep Strike, so long as the first model is placed within 6&quot; of a model with a locator beacon. The locator beacon must have been on the battlefield at the start of the turn in order for it to be used.</p>

<p><strong>Narthecium: </strong>As long as the Apothecary is alive, all models in his unit have the Feel No Pain special rule.</p>

<p><strong>Omniscope: </strong>A model with an omniscope has the Night Vision and Split Fire special rules.</p>

<p><strong>Rosarius: </strong>A rosarius confers a 4+ invulnerable save.</p>

<p><strong>Servo-harness: </strong>A servo-harness gives the bearer an extra servo-arm, a plasma cutter and a flamer. In the Shooting phase, the bearer can fire both harness-mounted weapons, or one harness mounted weapon and another weapon.</p>

<p><strong><strong>Plasma Cutter:</strong></strong></p>

<p><strong>Signum: </strong>At the start of the Shooting phase, a model with a signum can choose to use it instead of shooting. If he does so, one model in his squad is Ballistic Skill 5 for the remainder of the Shooting phase. Declare that the signum is being used before any rolls To Hit are made.</p>

<p><strong>Space Marine Bike: </strong>Models equipped with Space Marine bikes change their unit type to Bike, as described in the Warhammer 40,000 rulebook. Space Marine bikes are fitted with a twin-linked boltgun.</p>

<p><strong>Special Issue Ammunition: </strong>In addition to the normal profile for their boltgun (including boltguns that are part of a combi-weapon), models with special issue ammunition can choose, in each of their Shooting phases, to instead use one of the profiles below until thebeginning of their next Shooting phase. All models with special issue ammunition in a unit must use the same profile.</p>

<p><strong>Storm Shield: </strong>A storm shield confers a 3+ invulnerable save. In addition, a model equipped with a storm shield can never claim the +1 Attack gained for being armed with two Melee weapons in an assault.</p>

<p><strong>Teleport Homer: </strong>Friendly units composed entirely of models in Terminator armour do not scatter when they Deep Strike, so long as the first model is placed within 6&quot; of the teleport homer&rsquo;s bearer. For this to work, the bearer of the teleport homer must have been on the battlefield at the start of the turn.</p>

<p><strong>Armorium cherub: </strong>One use only. One model in a unit equipped with an armorium cherub can re-roll all
failed To Hit rolls in one Shooting phase. An armorium cherub is represented by a
separate miniature that will always remain as close as possible to the unit that selected it.
The model itself is purely decorative and is always ignored for game purposes â€“ just move
it to one side if it gets in the way. Remove the armorium cherub once it has been used or
once the unit that selected it has been completely destroyed.</p>
