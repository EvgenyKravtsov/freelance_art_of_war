<h1><strong>Vehicle equipment:</strong></h1>

<h3><strong><strong>Rules for the following vehicle upgrades can be found in the Warhammer 40,000 rulebook:</strong></strong></h3>

<p>Dozer blade, extra armour, hunter-killer missile, searchlight, smoke launchers, storm bolter.</p>

<h2><strong>CERAMITE PLATING</strong></h2>

<p>Melta weapons do not roll an extra D6 armour penetration when shooting this vehicle at half range or less.</p>

<h2><strong>FRAG ASSAULT LAUNCHERS</strong></h2>

<p>Any unit charging into close combat on the same turn as it disembarks from a Land Raider Crusader or Redeemer counts as having frag grenades.</p>

<h2><strong>IRONCLAD ASSAULT LAUNCHERS</strong></h2>

<p>A model with ironclad assault launchers does not suffer the penalty to its Initiative for charging enemies through difficult terrain. Furthermore, enemies charging a model with ironclad assault launchers do not gain bonus Attacks from charging unless the model was already locked in combat from a previous turn.</p>

<h2><strong>JAMMING BEACON</strong></h2>

<p>Enemies that scatter when deep striking within 12&quot; of a Land Speeder Storm roll double the number of dice to determine the scatter distance.</p>

<h2><strong>EXTRA ARMOUR</strong></h2>

<p>Vehicles equipped with extra armour count Crew Stunned results from the Vehicle Damage table as Crew Shaken results instead.</p>

<h2><strong>SIEGE SHIELD</strong></h2>

<p>A vehicle with a siege shield automatically passes Dangerous Terrain tests.</p>

<h2><strong>HUNTER-KILLER MISSILE</strong></h2>

<p>A hunter-killer missile is an additional weapon, fired using the vehicle’s Ballistic Skill.</p>
<h2><strong>CERBERUS LAUNCHER</strong></h2>

<h2><strong>SEARCHLIGHT</strong></h2>

<p>Illumination lasts until the end of the following turn. Illuminated units gain no benefit
from the Night Fighting rule.</p>


<h2><strong>SMOKE LAUNCHERS</strong></h2>

<p>Once per game, instead of shooting or moving Flat Out (or Running in the case of
Walkers), a vehicle with smoke launchers can trigger them. Place some cotton wool or
some other appropriate counter next to the vehicle to show it is obscured. The vehicle
may not fire any of its weapons in the same turn as it used smoke launchers, but counts
as obscured in the next enemy Shooting phase, receiving a 5+ cover save.
After the enemy’s Shooting phase, the smoke disperses with no further effect. Note that a
vehicle may still use smoke launchers even if has suffered a Crew Shaken or Stunned
result or it does not have any shooting weapons.</p>

<h2><strong>STORM BOLTER</strong></h2>
