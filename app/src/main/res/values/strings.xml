    <string name="_manual_text">To create a psyker, press “create psyker” button. If you want to create a non-special psyker (i.e. – sanctioned psykers from Imperium), choose a name, then select how many warp charges your psyker has and choose Psychic discipline.\n\n
        Depending on the combinations of Psychic disciplines, Psychic powers will work as intended by rules of Warhammer 40k Rulebook.\n\n
        If you choose 2 Psychic disciplines, your psyker won’t have a Primaris power from any of those disciplines. But you do have an ability to drop one of the Psychic powers and get a Primaris Power, like it is described in 7th Edition of Warhammer Rulebook.\n\n
        To drop the Psychic Power, press on any of your Psychic Powers and you will be able to change it.\n\n
        If you want to create a special psyker (i.e – Chief Librarian Tigurius), press “Add Special Psyker” button.\n\n
        You will then need to select your psyker from the list. Each special psyker has unique abilities, which we did our best to display in this application. For example, Tigurius has the ability Master of Prescience – “When generating psychic powers, Tigurius may re-roll any roll of the dice to see which powers he knows.”\n\n
        To choose a different Psychic power, simply press on any rolled Psychic power to change it. If one of your special Psykers always knows one of Psychic powers, it will be immediately shown in the list of known Psychic powers.</string>

        <item>21 Spawnhood: The champion is transformed into a Chaos Spawn. Place a spare Chaos Spawn model, on full Wounds, within 3" of the champion (or the vehicle in which he is embarked) and more than 1" from enemy models. Then, remove the champion model from play. If the Chaos Spawn cannot be placed, just remove the champion. The champion only counts as killed once this Chaos Spawn is removed as a casualty, or if it cannot be placed on the board. The champion is now a separate, unengaged, non-scoring unit that retains none of the champion’s special rules or wargear. It does, however, retain the same mark of Chaos (if it had one). If the champion was your Warlord, this Chaos  Spawn  remains your Warlord but loses his Warlord Trait.</item>
